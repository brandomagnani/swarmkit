  "title": "Why FPGA manufacturers keep their bitstream formats secret",
  "summary": "This December 2015 article argues that FPGA manufacturers' practice of keeping bitstream formats secret is not justified by their stated reasons (protecting customer designs, protecting chip IP, preventing customer damage, or supporting tools). The author refutes each argument with technical evidence. The discussion thread covers whether open bitstreams would enable better tooling, the economics of FPGA design, and the challenges of creating competitive open-source FPGA toolchains. Many commenters highlight the complexity of modern FPGA tools as the real barrier, not just the bitstream format, while others note that Project IceStorm's success with Lattice iCE40 proves that reverse-engineered and documented bitstreams can enable viable open tooling.",
  "what_happened": "Over the next 10 years, the prediction that open bitstreams could enable competitive tooling largely proved correct, though with caveats. Project IceStorm (mentioned in the discussion) became highly successful for Lattice iCE40, spawning a mature ecosystem with Yosys, nextpnr, and other tools. However, the bigger FPGA vendors (Xilinx/AMD and Altera/Intel) did not voluntarily open their bitstream formats. Instead, community efforts like Project X-Ray (prjxray) have successfully reverse-engineered and documented Xilinx 7-series bitstreams, and openXC7 now provides open tooling for Xilinx Series 7 devices. By 2024-2025, the landscape shifted significantly: nextpnr gained support for Xilinx devices, and a major milestone was achieved with open-source tooling supporting a 500k LUT space-grade FPGA (NanoXplore NG-Ultra) funded by the European Space Agency. The vendor toolchains (Vivado, Quartus) remain closed, bloated, and frustrating, but open alternatives have become genuinely viable for multiple FPGA families. Lattice, being more open-minded, released the Nexus 2 platform in late 2024. The joke about needing a 20GB download remains somewhat true\u2014vendor tools are still enormous\u2014but open alternatives now exist and work well.",

    "reason": "This commenter correctly predicted that open tooling on Lattice iCE40 would drive adoption and create a positive feedback loop: open tools \u2192 more users \u2192 better tooling \u2192 hardware improvements \u2192 entrenched user base. They also correctly anticipated that this could eventually threaten established FPGA vendors and that the openness of platforms like Linux had fundamentally changed the competitive landscape. They were right that companies like Intel (which acquired Altera) would eventually offer integrated FPGA+CPU solutions, and that Chinese vendors would enter the space. Their 10-year prediction about open FPGA tooling and SoCs with integrated FPGA fabric is coming true."

  "most_wrong": {
    "user": "jacquesm",
    "reason": "This commenter argued that 'there is no real demand for openness' and that FPGA manufacturers would never voluntarily open their formats because there's no business justification. They claimed that if openness really mattered, a manufacturer would 'surely take the lead and capture marketshare.' This was wrong because: (1) Lattice did exactly this by being more accommodating to open tooling, (2) Community reverse-engineering (iCE40, Xilinx 7-series) proved viable without vendor support, (3) Open tooling did drive adoption and user preference, as evidenced by testimonials like 'the workflow is far superior' mentioned in the comments. The argument that 'outside of the tinkerer world there's vast industry' that doesn't care was partially correct but too dismissive\u2014by 2024, open tooling was gaining professional adoption."

  "notable_aspects": "The discussion thread contains an actual Altera director (dkarchmer) commenting, providing insider perspective that opening up would require massive documentation effort and that the 'comprehensive tooling' (not just bitstreams) is what's complex. This comment has aged well and remains relevant. Also notable: the thread mentions specific projects that did materialize (icestorm, fpgatools, arachne-pnr) and users were already discussing whether to invest in reverse-engineering efforts. The prediction about Chinese FPGA vendors entering the market has partially come true (Gowin, Anlogic are now player). The discussion about whether bitstream format or comprehensive tooling is the blocker proved nuanced\u2014both matter, but the iCE40 success showed that with bitstream docs, the tooling community would build the rest.",

Correctly noted that every challenger to Xilinx/Altera has failed. However, underestimated how much the iCE40 momentum would matter and overestimated the permanence of the FPGA vendor duopoly. Also failed to anticipate the ESA-funded space-grade FPGA initiative."

This was speculative but not unreasonable. The timeline was too optimistic (10 years), and these technologies haven't materialized as predicted. However, the basic principle that simpler, more regular structures could enable open tooling was sound."

Believed open tooling would never succeed without vendor buy-in; proven wrong by iCE40 and later Xilinx community efforts. Right that capital requirements are high, but underestimated community ability to tackle niche markets and how niche markets could grow. The claim 'no real demand for openness' was contradicted by events."

This insight was partially validated\u2014vendors do avoid this commitment. However, the concern turned out to be less important than expected; community tools coexist happily with vendor tools even without guarantees."

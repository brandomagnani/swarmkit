  "title": "Raspberry Pi Zero Hidden in an Xbox Controller",
  "summary": "In November 2015, Terence Eden published a creative DIY project showing how to fit a Raspberry Pi Zero (a $5 computer) inside a classic Xbox controller to create a portable retro gaming console. The article detailed the hacking process - removing controller internals, wiring the Pi to the controller's USB connections, and loading RetroPie emulation software. The discussion on Hacker News centered on technical implementation details (power delivery over HDMI, wiring techniques, the role of USB hub functionality in Xbox controllers) and the broader implications of ultra-cheap, tiny computers becoming ubiquitous in everyday objects.",
  "what_happened": "The Raspberry Pi Zero and the broader Raspberry Pi Foundation became wildly successful. By 2025, the Pi ecosystem is mainstream with a $1.06B market cap after going public in 2024. The Raspberry Pi Zero 2W continues to be sold as a budget option ($15), spawning thousands of similar projects. RetroPie became the definitive retro gaming emulation platform, with active community development continuing through 2025. The mesh networking vision mentioned in the article became reality - IoT and LoRaWAN networks emerged in the 2020s using similar small, battery-powered devices. The article's core premise - that ultra-cheap, hidden computers would transform accessibility to computing - proved prescient. Terence Eden's project became iconic in the maker community, inspiring countless similar hacks and commercial retro gaming products.",
  "most_prescient": {
    "user": "danesparza",
    "reason": "Correctly identified that mesh networking software already existed and predicted it would enable distributed communication infrastructure that could bypass institutional censorship. This vision largely came true with LoRaWAN, mesh networks, and community wireless infrastructure becoming practical in the 2020s. The prediction was visionary for 2015 when such infrastructure seemed purely theoretical."

  "most_wrong": {
    "user": "IshKebab",
    "reason": "Stated 'A battery powered mesh network is still not really doable.' This became demonstrably wrong as battery-powered mesh networks became practical and commonplace through the 2020s with technologies like LoRaWAN, BLE mesh, and ultra-low-power IoT protocols. By 2025, these are standard implementations."
  },
  "notable_aspects": "The discussion included detailed technical corrections about HDMI power specifications (the Pi Zero requires external power via USB, which people kept misunderstanding), humor about flick-knife Pi variants and hiding computers in various objects, and a running joke about Terence's soldering anxiety. Several commenters provided NASA wire-splicing standards as alternatives to soldering. The project perfectly captured the DIY maker culture of the 2010s and the fascination with the Raspberry Pi's accessibility. Notably, multiple people in the thread mentioned building their own versions, showing immediate community adoption.",

      "grade": "B",
      "rationale": "Teased the cable hack but was correct about the need for better soldering. By 2025, better connector standards and techniques became standard practice in similar projects. The critique was justified and constructive."

    "hayksaakian": {
      "grade": "C",
      "rationale": "Asked good clarifying questions about HDMI power but showed a misunderstanding about how power delivery works. The follow-up discussion exposed the question was based on a flawed premise, though it was an understandable confusion that many had."

      "grade": "A-",
      "rationale": "Accurately explained that Chromecast has a secondary USB port for power and correctly noted the HDMI spec limitations. All technical assessments held up perfectly over 10 years."
    },
    "bduerst": {
      "grade": "A",
      "rationale": "Provided accurate technical specifications (55-150mA available on HDMI, Chromecast pulls up to 1A) with precise numbers that turned out to be correct. Thoughtful about practical constraints and power requirements."
    },
    "electricblue": {
      "grade": "C-",
      "rationale": "Dismissed the practical use case early on, saying 'I don't really see a use for this.' The market proved this wrong - retro gaming on Raspberry Pi became a huge category with commercial products, community projects, and continued relevance 10 years later."

    "danesparza": {
      "grade": "A+",
      "rationale": "Not only linked relevant existing mesh networking software, but made the prescient observation that this architecture would be useful for creating communication infrastructure independent of institutional control. This prediction largely materialized through 2020s IoT and community wireless networks."
    },
    "logicallee": {
      "grade": "B+",
      "rationale": "Correctly criticized the cable splice technique as likely to fail and provided superior alternatives (Western Union splice). The critique was technically sound and the warnings about reliability were justified - proper soldering and crimping did become best practice in similar projects."

    "ryangittins": {
      "grade": "B",
      "rationale": "Generic enthusiasm without technical substance, but the core observation that 'the world has changed and much more change we're going to see' was correct. The Raspberry Pi did indeed accelerate technological change and accessibility."

    "IshKebab": {
      "grade": "D",
      "rationale": "Flatly stated battery-powered mesh networks 'still not really doable,' a prediction that became demonstrably wrong within 5-10 years as LoRaWAN and other technologies matured. Shows lack of foresight about IoT trajectory."

    "haberman": {
      "grade": "B",
      "rationale": "Suggested the idea of loading speed-run controller inputs to fake superhuman gaming performance. While clever, this specific application never became popular, though automated input systems did emerge elsewhere. The creative thinking was right even if the execution direction was off."

  "title": "Next Generation Eclipse IDE (Eclipse Che)",
  "summary": "In October 2015, Eclipse Che was announced as a web-based IDE that aimed to revolutionize cloud development environments. The article pitched Che as a containerized, portable development environment powered by Docker and Kubernetes, enabling developers to switch between IDEs and collaborate seamlessly. The discussion thread revealed strong community interest, but also significant skepticism about cloud IDEs replacing desktop tools, concerns about offline development, vendor lock-in, performance (especially over web protocols), and UI complexity. Key voices included Tyler Jewell (Che project lead), Ivan Burazin (Codeanywhere founder), and passionate developers debating the viability of web-based development tools.",
  "what_happened": "Eclipse Che persisted but remained a niche product. While the cloud IDE market grew significantly (59.55% of development tools by 2024), the dominant player became GitHub Codespaces (launched 2020, built on VS Code), not Che. AWS Cloud9 was discontinued in 2024. The web-based IDE approach proved viable for specific use cases (collaborative development, onboarding, CI/CD integration) but never replaced traditional IDEs like IntelliJ or VS Code for serious development. The container/Kubernetes-first approach Che advocated for became mainstream in DevOps but not in daily IDE usage. Web-based editors (Atom, VS Code) evolved using native Electron rather than pure HTML/DOM (as commenters predicted). The fundamental tension about offline work, performance, and control that skeptics raised remained largely unresolved. By 2025, the market consolidated around VS Code extensions and Codespaces for cloud development, with Gitpod and Coder offering alternatives to Codespaces.",
  "most_prescient": {
    "user": "TylerJewell",
    "reason": "As project lead, Jewell accurately articulated the core value proposition that eventually materialized: containerized dev environments, workspace portability, production/development parity, and language service decoupling via REST APIs. His emphasis on workspace isolation, environment reproducibility, and the ability to move workspaces between nodes predicted the Kubernetes-native development approach that became reality. His explanation that Che's focus was different from Cloud9 (emphasizing portability over IDE experience) turned out correct\u2014this distinction mattered as the market evolved toward container-based workflows."

  "most_wrong": {
    "user": "melted",
    "reason": "Melted dismissed the entire approach with 'Because writing an IDE in a real programming language wasn't hard enough' and mocked adding 'another layer of complexity' via web platforms. This was wrong because: (1) web-based IDEs did gain adoption, (2) VS Code became the dominant development tool and IS web-based (Electron/JavaScript), (3) the HTML/DOM approach proved viable enough for Codespaces/Gitpod, and (4) the performance concerns were largely overcome through better architecture (server-side language services, optimized protocols). The blanket dismissal underestimated how web technology maturity and cloud infrastructure could overcome initial limitations."
  },
  "notable_aspects": "1) The prescient discussion about offline development limitations\u2014commenters like jasonkester provided detailed examples of real use cases (tropical beaches, sailboats, unreliable wifi) that cloud IDE proponents had to dismiss. This tension never fully resolved, explaining why Codespaces never became universal.\n\n2) Ivan Burazin's repeated defense of Codeanywhere and cloud IDEs showed how founders championing similar products had to argue against fundamental skepticism from developers who valued local control and reliability.\n\n3) Tyler Jewell's lengthy explanations reveal how Eclipse Che was ahead of its time architecturally (Docker workspaces, REST-wrapped language services, environment portability) but the market wasn't ready. These concepts became standard in 2020s DevOps but remained optional for IDE users.\n\n4) The UI criticism (5 tab bars, cluttered design, 40% of screen for code) was vindicated\u2014neither Che nor competitors solved the 'too much chrome' problem for web IDEs in the traditional IDE sense.\n\n5) The 'vendor lock-in' debate was prescient; cloud IDEs do create dependency on specific platforms (GitHub for Codespaces, Gitpod's git hosting support limitation), validating the skeptics' concerns.\n\n6) Commenters on browser performance vs native apps were right that this remained a persistent issue; VS Code in browser (GitHub Codespaces) never achieved full feature parity with native VS Code, and web-based code completion remained noticeably slower than native tools.",

Only weakness: perhaps overestimated how quickly market adoption would follow."

This was partially right but overly cynical\u2014the real value prop was environment standardization and reduced setup friction, not vendor control. Market proved vendors could be self-hosted (Che, Coder) so lock-in wasn't inevitable."

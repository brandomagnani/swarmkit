So does your grandmother clicking a link in the email if she has any hint of an idea that she's not supposed to click that link (e.g. if the email said \"you are not permitted to access this link\" it suddenly could be illegal to intentionally visit it).It's called the \"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\"[0].The exact portion is: \"Whoever intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains information from any protected computer\" is guilty of a criminal offence.This user of Gmail obviously surmised this was debug information he was not meant to see. As soon as he clicked that debug link or the detail link, he was intentionally accessing information without authorized access. He knew he was not supposed to access that information and he did so anyways.The CFAA has been used before for things not too far off for this. 3Tap[1] was found guilty of CFAA abuse when it scraped Craigslist after its IPs were banned.Weev[2] was prosecuted under the CFAA for accessing unprotected AT&T customer data that was hidden behind a url with an incrementing integer ID (no password, no username, just a perl script to increment a url parameter in a get request).This is a fairly well documented law that has been used a number of times and it's almost certain that the author is guilty under it, as written. It's one hell of a broad law.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigslist_Inc._v._3Taps_Inc.[2]: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/weevs-case-flawed-begi...",

You're preaching to the choir. I know it's dumb and doesn't make sense. This law was created by people who do not understand technology or the internet except by analogies to it being \"kinda like a supermarket\" or such.I gave suitable evidence that this is quite possibly illegal because of a dumb law.

I see 'mail.google.com' then 'about:blank' in the url bar, which indicates that he's accessing a public server and then probably accessing data already on his machine.  Data that they chose to send to him and present to him within his browser with controls that were displayed to him to allow him to access it because they decided he was authorized to see it.I don't know much about weev's case except that it sounds like it was information that AT&T had decided that the public was authorized to access without any authentication or protection.  They screwed up.  I agree that a lot of legal people are tech-illiterate, and they screw up, too.  Which may be why they eventually bailed on a venue technicality rather than address the actual case.But your point was: \"Whoever intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains information from any protected computer\" (which doesn't really sound that dumb on its own)My point is that you're authorized to access your own computer and it isn't protected from you, so that would not apply (unless the legals involved couldn't figure it out).  Is clicking the 'About' button in the help menu of an application and accessing the version number a crime?  Seeing the Gmail debug info in chrome is just that with more detail.  Try putting \"chrome://about\" in your Chrome url bar.  Ooh, there's data.  Lots of debug data.  Are you a criminal now?  No, it's your system and you're authorized to use it.  And the makers of Chrome chose to give you access to that data.  Just for fun, try chrome://quit/",

If he only realized that Google did not intend him to have that information after he finished screenshotting everything, maybe he's in the clear for intent.Again, this is similar to Weev. Weev found a url which AT&T gave him that had a number in it.

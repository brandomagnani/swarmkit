Maybe we get a new semiconductor material out of this.Unfortunately, it's on phys.org and in materials science, where overhyped major breakthroughs in surface chemistry (referred to as \"nanotechnology\") happen regularly.

They are doing this in ordinary air, not under an inert gas or something.  They're getting an amorphous diamond film, not a single crystal, and may be able to get diamond powder.

I was fascinated by the carbon nanotube stuff and set about to build some, and while it is \"easy\" to build nanotubes, it is \"hard\" to build a specific kind of nanotube, or a nanotube of a specific length, or one with specific properties. All the ways of making them that I explored could make pretty much any kind (single/double walled, conductive/non-conductive). And you can pull one out and say \"look here is this cool structure\" but there wasn't any way to make a few hundred thousand without going blind looking through a microscope.",

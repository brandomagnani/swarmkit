This is a classic example of a talented and dedicated people working on a bad idea and hoping that they can pivot their way to a good idea.As they rightly noted in the end people don\u2019t want to make their own clothes online. They want clothes that make them look good and project the image to the world that reflects how they want to be seen. No matter how well executed, this idea can\u2019t work except for the tiniest niche.I have often thought about how to make this market (the \u201cconsumer co-creation\u201d category) work and I have yet to figure out a way. The best idea I have had is to out Zara Zara. The Zara model it to keep the supply chains short (with a resulting high labor cost) and the stock turn over rapid so if something proves popular they can make more of it quickly (no ordering for summer in the middle of winter). It might be possible with better physical tracking and identification of the key influencers to be able to get a jump on what will prove popular with enough lead time that you can lengthen the supply chain to be able to take advantage of low cost labor, but I have not explored this idea.",

Even a relatively short name like Facebook is challenging to keep it readable from a short distance, let alone from a few meters.Similar for logos, with the additional challenge of logo placement. Where will you put the logo on a jeans? On the back? That will cause a lot of uncomfortable situations. On the front? Now you have to look down in front of the person wearing the trousers, making it even more uncomfortable.Maybe jeans in the exact company color could work, but you need a lot of different sizes.

Before you launch a startup, you have unlimited time (it's rarely true that you must be the first entrant in a market to succeed, so time is on your side). I would always tell them to do a \"feasibility analysis\" -- a long document in which you:\n1. Clearly state what it is your company does\n2. Clearly state who your customer is\n3. Clearly state why they will value you\n4. Are specific about what you're assuming about your customer, competition, wider economy, etc., that will drive you to success\n5. Validate that your customer exists and shares your perception of what value is\n6. Validate that all of your assumptions are trueThese usually took about 3 months of part-time work for the entrepreneur to complete, and, if they had a feasible start-up, they usually had customers in hand by the end of the process. If it wasn't a feasible start-up, they had the chance to pivot or just walk away, before spending any real money or real time.I love the idea of Getwear, and I really love the frank discussion of their failure.

Perhaps your conversion rate at $499 would drop to 0.3% but even so you just dramatically increased your profitOften times mispricing (either too high or too low) is why startups fail.",

We did work with ateliers that sold our jeans for $300, but a) the volume was still low and b) we were only getting our $99 out of the each pair. Besides, when you go for real bespoke, people tend to be much more picky \u2192 more returns and alterations as a result.",

    "text": "A couple of things I don't like about clothing startups is that they don't go after my demographic that has a problem, the cost of the products are way too high and they have an assumption that people have fashion sense.For example my problem is that I have not-so-lovely male gyno and I produce sweat stains on my T-shirts at a particularly high rate (such that when I find a shirt that fits and looks right its ruined in a couple of months). Thus I like the idea of customizing a piece of clothing but I just can't see how you could make it cost effective given I want to use different materials and cuts. Not to mention I want you to pick a good fashion for my body type.If the company went after a particular niche.. like shirts for ugly dudes to make ugly dudes look better instead of rich good looking young hipsters.. I might be interested :)",

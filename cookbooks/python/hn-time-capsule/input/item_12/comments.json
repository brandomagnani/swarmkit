Conway's Law says you create software that is a reflection of your organizational structure. What if the org structure changes, but you have a valuable legacy software product to support?

Since the manager's heap only uses blocks this size, she can do this all day without any problems or fragmentation.\"Maker time\" is a large contiguous block. If the heap is empty, you can allocate them without any problem. But stick one manager-sized block in the middle and now you've split your heap such that the total time available is large enough, but it's not contiguous. Classic heap fragmentation[2].pg's solution is the classic one in memory management: memory pools[3]. Partition your heap into regions for different-sized allocations. Small allocations always go in one region, large ones in another. \"Office hours\" is your small block allocator.I often hear people say, \"Look, I program in <high level language> with <giant standard library> all day. Why should I care about this old low level CS stuff?

    "text": "As a maker-turn-manager I've become skeptical of this perspective.  I think it's indulgent and misdirected.  Yes, if I as a manager schedule your time, I'm probably not going to schedule it for your best performance.  But I don't think the problem that as a manager I don't leave you giant blocks of uninterrupted time.  It's that as a manager I tend to interrupt your time with meetings that serve my role, and a manager's role tends to be focused on prediction, expectations, upward-directed planning, balancing work, status, risk... all things that aren't even intended to improve actual execution.  In theory of course a manager is supposed to be focused on team performance and execution, but the heaviest pressure on a manager is about how the team fits into the larger organization, not how the team works.If a maker's days are interrupted by meetings that are genuinely structured to improve their execution, I don't think the interruption is very concerning, and may be beneficial.  This theory about a Maker's Schedule, and these theories around attention, make these positive interruptions less likely to happen \u2013 the maker's become skittish about all meetings, become reclusive, sometimes causing a downward spiral because the maker actually needs those meetings and becomes more reclusive out of shame because the maker is confused and performing poorly.  Defensively the maker reacts against the structure that remains \u2013 the structure of meetings created by the manager, meetings which aren't supportive, where the maker is not sufficiently engaged to feel confident in repurposing the meeting... but the dysfunction is that in the face of these meetings a better response would be more meetings, better meetings, meetings where the makers leave the meeting ahead of where they started instead of behind.  But don't expect the managers to call those meetings \u2013 frankly as a manager I often can't make those meetings happen even when I want to.I'll also copy a post I wrote on the topic (https://plus.google.com/u/0/+IanBicking/posts/jgJCdMkzyBE):I'm somewhat pro-meeting, which maybe puts me at odds with the cultural norms of developers.I think I realize some of the problem.  Meetings tend to be called by managers.  Managers have management goals.  Process, deadlines, coordination, etc.  The developer sits around in case they provide some important input on one of those topics, or to give status, or to commit to a deadline.  Nothing in that kind of meeting helps the developer's work.  And the developer tries their best to withhold, to protect their own work, but also to protect the project which actually needs that output.In a developer-oriented meeting the topics would be decisions to make, architectural choices to consider, noting places of tension where a creative solution could be helpful.  In a developer meeting it is reasonable to take some time to look at code.  To do a bit of research \u2013 right in the meeting \u2013 to answer a question.  To brainstorm ideas.  If a problem is hard, it is reasonable that everyone go silent for a minute and ponder the problem.In The New Science of Building Great Teams (https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-te...) they discuss some evidence-based observations about communication patterns.  In it they suggest that high levels of communication lead to more productivity.  By developer sensibilities, very high levels.  But mostly peer interactions \u2013 developers interacting with developers.I'd really extend this to all the people engaged in making the product, design, user experience, user research, development, probably support and other roles.  In an ideal model there would be dozens of meetings, as different sets of these people came together to talk about what is relevant to those groups of people.  These meetings would not have clear and firm agendas, the product is the agenda, finding the agenda is some of the work of the meeting.It's easy to blame management for the unproductive meetings.  We're calling these snooze-fest status meetings.  But I'd turn it around: professionals shouldn't depend on management to initiate meetings. Sure management can try; I try to setup meetings I think will be productive for other people.  The Standup is the quintessential example.  But we know where those so often end up: as yet another management-led status meeting.  And it's a form without a clear purpose.  Who should be in the standup?  What should we talk about? When those things are defined by management we get management-style answers.  Even better than trying to fix the standup, keep it from being necessary: make the meetings that help everyone do their work, where the topic is always execution and not prediction or planning or status.With Project Managers and other professions focused on planning there is a danger that we defer to the specialists.  But everything needs to be planned.  The next line of code I write has to be planned. Developers have to be planners, every one of them.\ufeff",

    "text": "Another factor here is lots of pointless meetings, especially ones that rehash status or repeat status when there are no updates, are especially demotivating.Design meetings, one can live for, if one is interested in how to solve a problem.  Killing the design meetings is probably something to be avoided.The zone exists, to an extent.  I sometimes think there are parallels to something like videogame-esque canon that takes a long time to charge up.  The best work I'm going to do is going to come at some random hour during the day, and if I'm interrupted, the charge counter is likely to reset.  But maybe not.I'm sort of interrupt driven at times, and I think our culture being very triggered by email, phones, other things, can cause people to wait for interruptions to do things too.So there's a balance.  But yes, pointless meetings are bad things.  But it's ugly when there are meetings you have to have, and there's a backlash against the manager calling the meeting, because then \"the manager is something different\", and I think there's a bit of negative legacy to this article in that vein.Really, I think the question is to ask, at the end of whatever meetings, how much value did you get out of it, and what actionable conclusions came out of that meeting.  If the meeting doesn't produce action items (that hopefully get done before the next meeting of the same kind), it's not a good meeting.And meetings are really about getting people together that need to talk about something.  If it's not that, then don't do it :)Make sure everybody's time in there is valuable.  If you have a meeting where somebody only talks for thirty seconds out of an hour, it's probably not worth that person's time.  However, it's also destructive to think a meeting isn't worth someone's time, and use that to \"protect\" their time.Everybody should get to be involved in some decision making that wants to be.Do I find that in technical-manager-mode I can't code very well because I'm too distracted by 1000 different things?  Yes, pretty much.  And one of the first things I do is try to cut the B.S. management meetings and make sure the ones I'm involved in is important.  If you can't cut that, it's frustrating.But the complexity of having more people means conversations to organize things do have to happen, and to crush them in the spirit of \"meetings are bad\" can be dangerous too.I think that's wrong.  Again, the important part is to have the right meetings.  If you can block them out to happen during major blocks of time just a few days a week - most of the time - I think that's great.",

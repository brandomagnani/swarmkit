With the exception of a couple of really smart folks who wanted to \"own\" a significant part of yet-to-be-built Facebook, the most accomplished CS grads were joining Google in droves (Google was hot and on a hiring binge). Problems are Google seemed grander and more challenging and less toy-ish.Microsoft was another popular destination at Stanford at the time. If Facebook was toy-ish and Google was cool, Microsoft was \"respected\". Many deemed Microsoft to be the McKinsey of tech: spend a couple of years there, build their resume and join or start a start-up. I even knew someone who took a job at Yahoo! over one at Facebook (Needless to say, most everyone who had offers from either Google or Microsoft chose them over Facebook).Hindsight is 20/20 =)",

Maybe if interest rates were higher, companies wouldn't spend anywhere near as much on Facebook advertising.With that said, I think the current economic environment is more like 'froth' than a 'bubble'.\nA bubble can only get so big before it pops - Froth can keep building up to a considerable volume before it starts to deflate.Economy is a bit like ecology - If you raise the temperature (interest rates) by 5 degrees (5%), you could end up wiping out many species (companies) because of their complex interdependencies.",

The experience has really improved tremendously: delivering interesting content, connecting me to the restaurant or bar I am currently sitting, composing my pictures by \"Moment\".

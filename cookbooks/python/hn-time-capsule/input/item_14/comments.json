In reality it didn't work because lots of email services didn't correctly respond to the \"try again in a minute\" response - which is in the RFC!Maybe it's an extreme example.

I missed email from some people for a week before one of my coders noticed it and let me know, at which point I had to get colleagues to forward me any message with that address, contact the sender and ask them to remove it from their Outlook autofill settings, and repeat ad nauseum until correspondence started coming to me again.I sent a bug report, they responded \"we'll look into it\" and never heard another word about it, so for all I know it is still happening.  If we'd have integrated that into the company processes rather than just my using it to consolidate my calendars it would have been a serious problem.",

I'd be much happier working with services that use well-defined open standards that work with my choice of client software.I know that Sunrise isn't a Google-apps specific software, but after:\n* a co-worker sent me a screenshot of a meeting invite I had accepted via their app (along with a facetious question \"You get a new assistant? Who's 'Sunrise' and is she cute?\") that makes Sunrise branding too prominent for it to be appropriate for a professional environment, and\n* finding out that instead of masking a response with my email address it had sent it from a generic \"invites@sunrise.am\"-style email but showing up as my name \"Brer Lapn <invites@sunrise.am>\", and having to then contact over a dozen colleagues who had been emailing the black hole address at Sunrise---\nI'd say these services are less suitable for business purposes than the standards that Fastmail uses (and publicizes).  Fastmail has never screwed around with my emails or calendar invites, and unlike Gmail I can use multiple different clients without it filling my drafts folder with autosaves.TL;DR, if I had a say I'd be running our company tools on Fastmail rather than Google Apps (although deliverability is definitely something I'd consider a showstopper, I've never had an issue with FM).",

Silently dropping email (no smtp transaction bounce, not in junk, no rules in place) for a specific single sender at a domain, where email from other senders at the same domain is accepted. Hundreds of people have posted about this online with no fix or acknowledgement from Microsoft.2. Overly strict hardfail SPF policy by default for new customers who have no idea of SPF and should be using softfail. These customers often use third party systems to send out hundreds of account statements. These get blocked by other email hosts. The customers themselves have no idea and never correct their SPF, saying something like \"it must be an issue on your side\".3. Blocking entire /24 IP ranges including good senders with good reputation, on the basis of only a single spammer in the range. This particularly affects those in datacenters, even if you are on a dedicated machine and your IP is good.4. It may be that Office 365 does not track or measure domain reputation at all, which makes things like SPF or DKIM of little positive use, and introduces loads of spam false positive bounces.",

I don't even care if it's exposed over CardDAV, I just want to get automatically-added addresses out of my normal user addressbook. A couple of weeks ago I realized that my addressbook had a bunch of contacts in it I didn't recognize, so I cleared them all out. Today I checked and there's 3 more unwanted contacts.It actually feels very broken to me that FastMail is automatically adding things to my address book without asking me, and without any obvious way to turn it off. I don't mind it recording this stuff in a separate addressbook to use for spam filtering and for auto-filling during message composing, but it should not be part of my normal addressbook and should not be coming down over CardDAV for my user addressbook.The reason this is a problem is because I use my FastMail CardDAV addressbook as a shared addressbook for me and my wife (she doesn't use FastMail herself but I do), since we use iCloud for our normal address books but iCloud doesn't have a way to share addressbooks. It occurs to me now that since I'm actually using a Family account (for a single user, so I can have a custom domain without having the more expensive plan), I have a Shared address book available and I should just switch over to that (since I assume nothing ever auto-adds there). But it was still a rude surprise to find a bunch of unknown contacts appearing in my Contacts app on iOS.",

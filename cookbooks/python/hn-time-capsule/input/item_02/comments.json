And you won't be able to stick on the old one, because within a week or two some critical security flaw will be discovered and eventually (like six weeks later) they'll stop supporting those for old Firefox.Initially the HTML Firefox will suck. When you take an app that's been worked on for 15 or so years and then replace it's UI you're going to lose a TON of features. They'll slowly reintroduce some of the most popular features (hamburger menu will be priority #1!) but there will be a TON that they will not reintroduce. Why? Because when they were first introduced a decade ago it was a cool idea someone had, and no one knew how popular it would be, so heck, why not implement it. But now they know that only 10 million or even 1 million people use that feature, and they're only interested in 100 million user features! If Google Chrome doesn't have it, it must not be important!As much as people complain about XUL not looking native, wait for HTML Firefox, it will take them forever to get where XUL was years ago.They can't just kill XUL for Firefox though, they have to burn down the XUL ecosystem first so they're just releasing a new Firefox, nothing to see here.1. They try to kill xulrunner as a project separate from Firefox. They try to move everyone to firefox -app.2. They stop releasing binaries for xulrunner.3. They deprecate XUL extensions.4. They distance themselves from Thunderbird. They say it's better for Thunderbird. Yeah right! Thunderbird is built on XUL, it's not going to be rewritten in HTML any time soon, definitely not by volunteers. It's not going to be able to maintain XUL either, and when Mozilla stops supporting XUL for Firefox a few years after deprecating XUL extensions then Thunderbird will be screwed, but hey, it's not our project! We abandoned it years ago!So when the crappy HTML Firefox shows up, with way less features than the Firefox of today, remember that this (Thunderbird) was one of the things given up to have it.But hey, donate to Mozilla! $5, $15, $25, anything helps.

Two were basically HLL machines with type-safety and interface safety enforced at hardware level. System/38 was object-based with HW- and SW-level protections plus portable microcode layer.I'd say Channel I/O counts as one that kicks modern systems' asses. Servers have been copying it bit by bit over past ten years, maybe even exceeding it, but server OS's are inherently inferior in usage given mainframe OS's are designed for I/O offloading at core. Near interrupt-less architecture with acceleration engines makes many apps scream with performance. And would only cost $10 per CPU on desktops but would require Windows & Linux rewrites.

I think the fact that it's pricey and proprietary kept the OSS innovation out, too.However, the change to the AS/400 and POWER cost it one of its greatest features: hardware-enforced integrity at the object level. That's the feature that would still be giving hackers hell if it was widely deployed. The Intel i432 APX and i960MX had similar property. Interesting enough, IBM actually has secure CPU's they've prototyped and even sold to select customers. Would be great if they integrated one with IBM i at microcode, compiler, and OS levels.

All hidden in mumbo jumbo of modules and dependencies no-one really needed or asked for, often created by people who never questioned the purpose of what they were doing, or if the whole internet needed it (because you are at Google and have found a neat way to deal with your huge JS stack doesn't mean the whole web needed it too, and that you needed to spent a whole lot of effort making people adopt it).As much as you make fun of C, learning and writing C will teach you to keep you programs simple and efficient, because the language requires it. And that's coming from someone who started programming with Perl, then PHP, and only learned C later on.Makes thing simple not simpler should be the cardinal rule of programming, not modularize and test everything, those are situational, the former applies all the time.",

Not only are we moving Firefox away from XUL, but we are likely going to make significant changes in the way the UI is structured. It is likely that some parts of the UI will be implemented using native widgets, and other parts will be implemented in HTML, but the exactly DOM structure may involve independent connected with well-defined API surfaces.Official statement from the Mozilla post in the discussion regarding removal of support for \"heavyweight\" themes. Emphasis mine.That\u2019s a pretty clear statement that it won\u2019t be 100% HTML.Also, the fact that \"arbitrary styling and scripting\" won\u2019t be possible is another issue.Tell me how I am supposed to write an addon that adds tab-previews as thumbnails when you hover over a tab like Vivaldi is doing it: http://i.imgur.com/vqysJs1.png ?How am I supposed to write an addon that colors the navbar and the current tab in the theme color given by the HTML, or, if not existing, the favicon?With current addons I can do that, with the new addon system, I\u2019m seriously fucked.",

The problem is that Thunderbird has had a serious technical debt problem since the day its code-base transitioned from Netscape.  Its low-level integration with Gecko has been a maintenance burden for Thunderbird developers and non-Thunderbird developers alike.The Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation put serious financial resources into trying to address both of these problems with the creation of Mozilla Messaging.  The idea, as I understand it, was to attempt to alleviate the burden on Firefox development by separating Thunderbird development while simultaneously providing Thunderbird with\npeople and resources to attempt to address this technical debt.\"\"An important question that falls out from all of this is and your original question is: which is more important?  Mail user agency or Thunderbird the product, especially if there are serious opportunity costs related to Thunderbird?Within the funded efforts of the Mozilla Corporation[2], mail user agency has not been abandoned and continues to be advanced as part of an open development process.\"",

It\u2019s explicitly not to announce changes in daily activities at this point.  People using Thunderbird will not see any change in the product they use.   We have started this conversation early because Mozilla works best when our community is engaged.  This is how we gather the people who are interested, and enable those folks to engage productively---So this is exactly not a case of confronting people with made decisions, but discussing long term strategic considerations in the open. Bakers message is actually remarkably explicit about this, discussing various pros and cons explicitly out in the open.---> 10. The fact that the Foundation is facilitating these discussions does not necessarily mean that the Foundation is or is not the best legal and financial home for Thunderbird. The intent is not to make technical decisions about support of Thunderbird by Mozilla employees, or merging repositories, etc. Point 6 above is the shared organizing principle for both of us.---So Mozilla is actually not talking about no longer supporting Thunderbird, they are talking about decoupling the projects, possibly within Mozilla.

Two issues:1) Pocket is basically a centralized service to keep track of your reading. This goes quite clearly against Mozilla's own message of placing privacy and users' rights above everything else. Shipping such a feature as opt-out and fundamentally un-removeable is just bad on every possible level; it could have been worse only if Mozilla had started routing all your traffic through Microsoft servers.2) There are umpteen services like Pocket, always have been, and none of them ever got a button in Firefox. So why Pocket? Why not one of the bazillion other services? Who chose it and why? Does that mean FF's toolbar is now open for business? Who do I bribe to get a button? ... That's a very opaque and fundamentally corrupt process, in an organisation constantly preaching openness.You can ask a priest how it feels having to constantly adhere to a higher moral standard; it's the price you pay for getting people to listen to you, trust your judgement, and give you free labor. At any time you can just stop preaching and go do your own thing, but then you can't expect other people to still follow you.> This is why Free Software will never happen at scale. Lol.

[1] As a long time Thunderbird user in an Exchange/Outlook environment, I'm disappointed each time I hear news about its priority being pushed further down.The TechCrunch article says, \"Apart from the fact that Mozilla had cut off most development support in 2012, Thunderbird has become a somewhat anachronistic product.\" For any enterprise or business environment where email still rules, calling Thunderbird \"anachronistic\" sounds misinformed and insulting. Thunderbird may not have the market share of Outlook or the glamor of smartphone based mail apps, but I'm sure those who use Thunderbird are really passionate about what it provides and the extensibility that comes with it.One of the things I don't like about the Mozilla of the past few years is the high amount of effort and time spent on Firefox OS. I don't want to put that down, but Mozilla is trying very hard with very less traction on it and still pushing onward.Mitchell's message sounds like more planning is in the works to separate Thunderbird and probably make it stand on its own. This will take some time to plan and execute, with Thunderbird just languishing in the meantime. There could also be a complete re-write of Thunderbird, which is not really a great idea. I can see both optimistic and pessimistic views on what the future holds.When Mozilla Messaging was announced, I had high hopes for better integration with Exchange calendaring and also improved search. All that went to nothing in 2012.If Thunderbird ends up as a separate entity that I can donate directly to, I'll be one of the first to do so![1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10650432",

It's a CLI app, yes, but it outshines Thunderbird (and most other GUI clients, for that matter) in a number of ways:- FAST. Mutt lets you process thousands of messages in short order. Mutt is directly responsible for helping me dig out of a 50k deep email hole brought on by years of GMail's approach (archive, never delete) in a few days of on-and-off cleanup.- Plays well with others. Uses a bog standard Maildir format that anything sane can read (including Thunderbird, so migration should be easy), provides a very powerful hooking system which can do anything from verifying PGP signatures to checking your spelling before sending to displaying attachments.- Sane defaults. Doesn't require a lot of in-depth customization to provide the basics, and the bells and whistles are hardly out of reach.- You have a backup of your mail for free (by using OfflineIMAP)- Not hard to learn (at least for the crowd here). If you can use Vim, you can be using Mutt at full speed in less than a week.- Search capabilities that blow nearly every other project out of the water (regexes with some very cool niceties)[1]- Secure by design. Mails are rendered as plaintext, HTML is decoded by piping messages through a program like w3m.

Yesterday I tried GTAV out again for a little bit and I observed that it was ... way too choppy and basically unplayable. I couldn't figure out the reason why. Then I saw that Thunderbird was the only application that was open aside from Steam and GTAV. I closed it down again and boom, back to consistently high framerates.What is the catch here?

For example, it allows using OAuth for authentication, and it has separate fields for folders and labels, depending on the backing email service. (And unlike IMAP, the labels field is actually useful.) You can also download a transaction log to make sync faster, which I don't think has an analog in IMAP.Subjectively, I've found the performance to be rather snappy in most cases.(You can also run a local client of the sync engine, if you don't want to trust their hosted copy: https://github.com/nylas/sync-engine)",

Happy to jump in here :)The sync engine handles all the compatibility or dozens of IMAP and Exchange servers, and uses a variety of heuristics for real-time notifications. It also does the heavy-lifting for the huge amount of data in most people's mailbox. The N1 app can cache your entire archive in about 10% of the disk space required if you also download all unprocessed headers+attachments.Right now our search implementation just sends a proxy request to the IMAP search, so you'll get the same performance as Gmail web, Mac Mail, etc. It's not ideal. We're working on our own faster search system, but it's tough to build a huge distributed search cluster that handles tens of terabytes. (And is growing quickly!) If anyone here wants to work on that, we're also hiring. ;)N1 is built on Electron, which under the hood is Chromium+NodeJS so that comes with a bit of weight.

As a result, I think that it has a better chance than other open source mail clients of providing an experience that's as polished and complete as Gmail. Doing that requires a bunch of affordances like calendar integration, Youtube previews, warning if you forgot to add an attachment, 10-second \"undo send\", and so on. Letting the community write those as add-ons seems smart.To really make Nylas compelling over Gmail, and also to replace Thunderbird, here's what I think needs to happen:1. Bundle Sync Engine and N1 into a single program.2. Implement local search. Faster than IMAP search and doesn't rely on a network connection.(As it stands, Nylas requires an internet connection to work. As long as that's the case it's no Thunderbird replacement at all, and will have a v hard time winning over Gmail users.)The good news is that both Sync Engine and N1 are GPLv3, so it's totally possible. The bad news is complexity:* Sync Engine is written in Python and uses MySQL for persistence* N1 is built with Coffeescript + React + Electron, and uses SQLite for persistenceSo we need to simplify. We can't just bundle all that into an app, it would be a monstrosity. Here's how I think we could do it instead:* Use Sync Engine as the basis for a Node library for IMAP sync* Use the SQLite full-text feature (fts4) for searchThat way you'd have a single Electron app with all persistence in SQLite.I'm prototyping this now.

The \"convenience\" of a Thing That Does Everything will also introduce fragility and bloat (and maybe even security exposures).For example, I would probably love to call functions to lay out some rectangles for me.  I know a web engine can do that really well, and I don't even mind passing in CSS strings to describe what I want.  The problem is, I don't want \"Internet in a box\" to come with it; I just want the layout in that case.  It would also be a lot easier to identify problems and contribute solutions if there was a way to \"only\" do X and focus on that part of the engine to fix.It would be awesome to be able to take those kinds of low-level details, and start really going cross-platform with them.  Make a library that can finally lay out whatever the hell you want consistently across machines, that can be patched into all existing UI libraries or other tools.  Make a portable text rendering and text layout system.  Make a portable GL viewer.  But don't tell me that each of those things only works if I create an InternetInBoxView.  Instead, refactor InternetInBoxView to use those separate parts.",

Also I find its calendar option quite hideous actually, it tries to mimic Outlook but that's not a good thing imho. The best calendar I've used is Calendar.app on Mac OS.Of course you can't blame anyone but us, the community. The one EWS plugin for Thunderbird is pay-2-play and the one for Evolution is the one having all the issues. So either Microsoft is hard to develop for or demand isn't high enough.",

And refreshing the folder list doesn't fix it. The hierarchy gets broken, and I regretfully can't screenshot it.(2) where is the junit runner? One of the reasons I think IDEs are pretty great is that I can run single junits, and I don't see this working in any capacity.(3) Why do I see menus for svn / git? What about hg? I prefer to use command line for source control, can I hide these?(4) Is the timeout for the build configurable? I have a build that takes several minutes due to a large number of tests, and it is unable to build due to a timeout(5) the auto complete seems very broken; maybe it is my project (using maven). It appears to import the dependencies just fine, but beyond that it produces a lot of errors.(6) I thought this would have the eclipse refactor support, but I do not see it.",

Eclipse is my main IDE, so I would say I'm fairly a power user for Eclipse.This is not a new version of the existing Eclipse (or Intellij).  It's not a desktop app at all, it's a web server that starts and then your browser opens the EclipseCHE \"web app.\" The IDE is merely a web interface - everything is happening on the CHE server (which would make the most sense if you install it on a separate machine altogether).As far as the IDE, it's actually kinda amazing for a web app. If the browser chrome was missing it would seem like a desktop app (except the menus are in the wrong place for OSX). The intellisense doesn't seem to be working yet as far as I can tell. Maybe this is just PHP, though? It shows valid PHP code highlighted in red as if it were an error (edit - restart seems to have fixed this). I wish so badly that one of the dark themes for Eclipse looked this good, though. I've tried for days to get a decent dark Eclipse theme going - they all suck.It seems that it may be creating a docker container for your project. You don't open local files on your machine (there is actually an 'upload' function to add a file to your project though). The files don't exist on your normal filesystem - they exist on the server, perhaps in a container, or just some internal folder structure that the server controls..? It seems to want to handle it all magically, which means I can't easily try it out on one of my existing apps. This is not really normal for my PHP workflow, but perhaps it would be perfect for those who have their app already in docker containers?I can't get an application to run at this point. I have docker installed, but it just hangs with the message \"Your request is queued waiting for a node to become available...\"Overall, it looks extremely interesting - especially for a team environment where everything is containerized. Just point a new team member at a URL - and the IDE and server environment is 100% set up, ready for them to start coding, debugging and running the app. There would be essentially zero setup time for working on your app.",

Or the bar that shows your code blocks can't be styled (controlled by the OS). So you wind up with a mostly dark theme that has 2 or 3 blaring, ugly, mismatched elements that defeat the purpose.Styling the editor window is something I've spend days tediously trying to tweak a nice pastel color pallet (that pretty much every app with a dark theme uses).  But all the included ones are bright neon colors or just radically weird color choices. I've been able to get my code window 95% the way I'd want, but then all of the other windows like the explorer or the console don't match!

You can either have a localhost machine or a docker machine.  Right now each workspace can only be bound to a single machine environment, but in a couple months we'll release multi machine bindings, so that you could launch a docker compose, for example, as a way to bind your workspace.The binding of your workspace happens behind the scenes.  When you boot or shutdown the workspace, we take care of managing the machines.  If you are using docker, then those machines are running out of process.  If on linux we use docker natively.  We use docker machine on mac or windows.Once the machines are booted, we bind all of your projects into the workspace, which are mounted into the machines.  Inside of the workspace machine, we launch another version of che.  Based upon the programming language you choose, we are running intellisense services inside of the machines.  For java, we actually run the native JDT code.We then put RESTful wrappers around this, which enables the browser to have full intellisense capability.  We have more work to do in integrating the JDT code with our restful wrappers and the UI, but it works well.We now support refactoring, a lot of content suggestions, find usages, and so forth.You can snapshot your workspace and use that image to load it again.Your files are dual mounted between Che the workspace manager and your workspace environment.  If you edit files in one, they are updated in the other.  so you can ssh into your workspace or not.  We provide a terminal into the workspace as well.When you execute a command, we translate that into a process and then docker exec it inot a machine as well.",

Lately it's been less, while working with very low level systems.Surely the first point has prevented many memory intensive projects from using idiomatic Java, and opted on serialization to byte[], memory mapped files or Unsafe tricks. Forced to go objects of arrays instead of idiomatic arrays of objects. You can make it fast and consume little memory, but not without some considerable pain.The second point has prevented me from choosing Java as a technology quite a few times. Sometimes you just need to provide a shared object (dynamically linked library) that can be loaded with all those languages with C-linkage.Third point is of course a matter of opinion. While OpenJDK is great and all, Oracle has behaved like a cage rattling gorilla in the past. Who knows what they'll still be up to, if they get in a tough enough situation?

In a distributed cloud environment, it's developer bootstrapping, securing distributed workspaces, and moderning legacy build processes. These are capabilities that only exist when you have a shared distributed server system.We took the kernel and created a new IDE out of it to demonstrate a couple things:\n1. Environment & workspace portability\n2. RESTful services on top of language tools like JDT\n3. Production / development container interoperability\n4. Extension framework for a cloud IDEWe haven't launched Che yet becuase the legal & branding review process at Eclipse is extensive. We hope to finally be done within 3 more months.But we encourage everyone to check out 4.0 branch of git and then build that.It is doing a few things:\n1. Worksapces are quietly powered by environments, backed by machines which are docker or localhost. This enables each workspace to be isolated with a stack apart from others.2. We will also demonstrate workspace portability. You can move an entire workspace and all of its tools from Che to Che, or from Che to cloud. And the environment will continue to run identically in each location.3. We are running the full JDT and other language services inside of the machine. We wrap these with RESTful wrapper. And then it allows the browser to gain capabilities for maven, refactoring, and a variety of powerful intellisence, and it's generally the same speed as localhost.4. You can then exec commands, debuggers, and ssh into the workspace machines.5. We have also done a project with Red Hat to enable your workspace environments to have the same docker container structure as production. We will shortly release a plug-in for OpenShift and Kubernetes that let's projects move back and forth with limited configuration. Becuase they are both running on a common container architecture.While we can solve workflow problems in our distributed system, such as a workflow we call continuous development, we wanted to have a fully fledged desktop IDE to demonstrate that this could have the performance and security of other types of tools.  So we are working to have this installation be very fast and lightweight.You guys are seeing the intermediate builds so it's got a lot of rough edges.Note: Please if you are going to do some testing, try it on the 4.0 branch.  The design is much better and the performance is very good.  The 4.0 branch is when we started embedding the JDT services into the mini Che that runs inside of the workspace machines.\ngit clone https://github.com/codenv/che\ngit checkout 4.0\ncd assembly-sdk\nmvn clean install",

We are beyond that point in terms of software complexity.

And a couple months sailing in the San Blas islands off Panama.  Parks, campsites and random comfortable boulders in the forest are pretty regular worksites, even building real shipping products with paying customers.Even the dreaded English Coffee Shop really happened (I live there half the time and have a hard enough time getting BT to deliver internet to my house with any reliability).I find that a good IDE removes pretty much all the Googling from my life.  I know what you mean though, having written my share of Ruby and Python, where you're constantly on Google trying to remind yourself what order to pass parameters to File.Open(), and completely aswim with a 3rd party API.  But Intellisense knows everything there is to know about C#, Javascript, CSS, etc. and will either tell me about it or just finish writing my line of code for me with a quick key chord.I tend not to rely on 3rd party code for simple things I can write myself, so I don't spend as much time Googling React or Angular into submission as your average modern dev.  For genuine 3rd party APIs like AWS or Stripe, you're right.  It's hard to test that stuff until you're back online.  They all have libraries though, and again the IDE has your back as far as implementation is concerned.Good luck with the RV life!http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/uploaded_images/parrot...\nhttp://www.blogabond.com/Photos/PhotoView.aspx?imageID=8479\nhttp://www.blogabond.com/Photos/PhotoView.aspx?imageID=992",

Their environments, which are the stack of tools and runtimes that you need to perform work on the code such as refactoring, debugging, compiling.We have created an abstraction of the worksapce to the environment that it is bound to.  And then this entire definition is exportable and movable between Che instances or to a cloud that is supporting Che, such as what Codenvy will run.Because the workspace definition defines its machines in the workspace object, then we can recreate the exact machine you need to do the same work on another node.We use docker to implement this behavior.We are not fully done with all of this work, but we have a lot of prototypes that prove this can do well.There are some challenges - if you want to \"save\" your workspace, do we snapshot the machines every time, or only sometime?  Do we force a remote commit & push?  it'll be up to the user.  But once all of the commits are done, then we have to push the images into a shared registry and ensure that everything is remotely accessible.Once all of this is done then any other machine can reproduce an identical workspace.",

Maybe the OS can even save memory if you run multiple instances on stuff like executables, etc.What I really don't like is how developers are pretending that HTML is the only client side technology if you go client->server route. To me architecting this as a HTML app shows 0 benefits - the install time is irrelevant - I am a developer - I know how to install applications and I do this for all my other IDEs, the time it takes me to install a thin client is irrelevant.All this \"use JS/DOM as front end\" does is either :compile to JS -> introduce an extra compile step, a shitty VM emulation, worries with interop and leaky abstractionsuse JS -> poor semanticsand both are abusing a layout model made for documents into application development model that gets really inefficient at rendering.IDEs are at the top of GUI complexity - why make shit even more complicated by doing things that slow development down - if they would for example write the frontend in something like JavaFX (not having used JavaFX I'm only speculating here, but I heard good things) it would probably be equally good (if not better) and at the same time it would make development a lot simpler.",

I had been offline from programming for 7+ years and lost most of my skills.  When I tried to get current with maven, java, eclipse, tomcat, I was unable to get a simple program to compile.I had a simple thought - it should be possible to let anyone anywhere contribute to any project without first installing software.  you should be able to click a link and then everything you need is generated for you - the workspace, the projects in that workspace, the environments that power those workspaces.Now, if you are on a desktop, you may want to wire in your existing IDE to integrate with that workspace. But if you are a product manager and just want to test some code, you don't want to install anything.  So a browser experience is necessary then.Generally, we have never seen the browser experience as the replacement objective or substitute. But it is a necessary deliverable for those who do not wnat to bother with installing software first.Codenvy takes Che and is working to provide this sort of no-install workflow around a concept we call factories. You start in a private anonymous screen, click a link and everything you need to continue working is there.  Really hard problem - that is what we focus on commercially.But at the core of it, we needed a portable workspace server that had a web IDE.  We chose GWT for the development of the GUI because of the cross browser portability and performance optimization. It's a brutal technology but we get a lot of nice optimizations.  We have started some explorations to support Vaadin for dynamic reloading of widgets and have some partners who may help us with a pure JavaScript client, too.We are embedding all of the language services within the machines that power the environments that the workspace is bound to. We use either localhost or docker depending upon your configuration. Since everything is within, the actual comms between browser and the workspace machine is limited. So you can get a pretty darn good expeirence.  The file operations are localhost native, so we are able to process Java files with 50K lines at about the same speed that Eclipse or Netbeans does (minus the part of the file system being inside of the docker container).",

No matter how many plugins I throw in there, the size of my project, the number of files open, ST always feels like the most responsive thing I've ever used.I don't have any objective data, but perhaps it's due to the Kool-aid. It was the second text editor I used (Notepad++ being the first). I fell in love immediately.",

They could make \"portable profile WPF\" from it if they wanted, and also target mobile and desktop, from Visual Studio and Visual Studio Blend - the ultimate Enterprise app development platform",

                                "text": "With vscode there are some clever architectural choices they made to create a near native experience. They use stdin / stdout integration between native services (like those for Go programming language) and the editor itself.  It's anothe form of reuse for the libraries that already do intellisense, compilation, or other syntax-specific functions.In the 2nd and 3rd generation codenvy systems, we tried to duplicate some of the JDT capabilities for Java directly within the browser with webworkers. We had to write that in JavaScript.  I believe this is how C9 handles their support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.We had pretty decent support, but there were all sorts of issues: having to rewrite JDT services is nearly impossible and really the domain of language teams, the browser has limited context where many intellisense services need access to multiple directories and meta information, and there were some performance issues in certain edge cases that are hard to resolve without having certain I/O and cache mechanisms (which are readily available on file systems).So the VSCode model of reusing the language services and then layering on a stdin / stdout protocol is pretty smart.  We are doing a similar approach with Che, but instead of stdin / stdout, we are packing a restful interface on top of the JDT & JavaScript services.  We see some potential to consolidate vscode & other approaches into a multi-language intellisence server, powered by REST + stdin + stdout.  That would be really fun to have all programming languages remotely accessible through a common protocol.",

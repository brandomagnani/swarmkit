The new rich sets target to make X amount of money and then \"retire\". Their \"retirement\" consist of working hard doing their favorite activities and travelling the globe to sample the \"regular folks\" flavors. Most of them don't have desire to keep growing billion dollar business which will sip away their time and energy. They have strong political belief but have no desire for acquiring political power directly or indirectly. They are not in to heavily influencing how rest of the population shall live. They consider time to do their favorite activities far more important than keeping money scoreboard. They want to buy fashionable cloths and accessories but not those that will immediately attract attention and single them out in the crowd. They want to be physically fit and avoid having family as long as possible. They like to invest in ideas and technology more than traditional financial instruments.I think new rich crowd will almost completely replace old generation wealthy in next 50 years or so.

One might be tempted to look to other countries for systems that work better, but there has to be a political path forward for implementing those systems here.One good teacher can only teach so many. That good teacher may not be good at teaching teachers. Teaching is not warfare, where good soldiers can teach other people to teach soldiers.Teachers that are good at teaching teachers can only teach so many teachers. Any attempt to scale a working method will eventually run out of talent. And if you don't stop when you run out of talent, then the quality of your teaching will inevitably go down. Universities can only get so big.Billionaires who want to put their wealth towards education are pretty limited in their options.",

It's legal, but it's totally uncalled for and it's clear to see why: a lot of what Pfizer stands on is from NIH-funded research, it's from us the tax-payers.

It's (essentially) impossible to show compliance with all possible spiritual interpretations thereof.The Internal Revenue Service (of the US) writes:Avoidance of taxes is not a criminal offense. Any attempt to reduce,\navoid, minimize, or alleviate taxes by legitimate means is permissible.\nThe distinction between evasion and avoidance is fine yet definite. One\nwho avoids tax does not conceal or misrepresent. He shapes events to\nreduce or eliminate tax liability and upon the happening of the events,\nmakes a complete disclosure. Evasion, on the other hand, involves\ndeceit, subterfuge, camouflage, concealment, some attempt to color or\nobscure events, or making things seem other than what they are.Did this Dutch company purchase product/services from this Irish company?Did these two companies merge and the surviving company was the non-US company?Did this executive receive stock options on such-and-such date?Those are all relatively easy questions of fact.Should the surviving entity of the merger have been the US company? (According to whom? Or on what basis? To what end? Which benefits the investors the most? What did the shareholders vote to do with their company? Why should someone else judge that what they did was \"legal but improper\"?)The real issue is simply that the US is relatively uncompetitive as a corporate domicile (on a rates and particularly on a \"worldwide income basis\") Attempts to patch the system without addressing this root issue are unlikely to succeed in a clean and sustainable fashion, IMO.",

When you're poor it's very hard to save much of anything. Housing, transportation and food can quickly eat up most of a weekly paycheque.> Our ability to generate the paycheck or our ownership of assets on average outstretches the vast majority of the planet.Nobody is arguing the US the is place to be if you have money. The point I'm trying to spell out for you is that the averages you discuss are massively skewed by huge inequality. America's middle class are no longer the world's richest and they are shrinking in number. More, America is increasingly opting for a a system of governance that is leaving more and more people behind, especially its most vulnerable.",

Put another way, if we used the living conditions of someone at the poverty line right now and used that to define the poverty line in 1970, over half of the 1970 population would be below the poverty line..... the definition [of poverty] is tied to CPI, which is tied to housing costs, which are more likely to include the cost of a full kitchen now than in the past especially for people near the bottom. I would argue that for someone in that position, having a full kitchen is better than not. Yet the CPI-based measure treats the cost of having a full kitchen as a negative (inflation), without treating the benefit of the full kitchen as a positive[end copied segment]Point being, the definition of \"poverty\" has some hidden inflation built in.",

The world is full of Koch Brothers, Saudi princes and European heirs to prove that most billionaires are more concerned about evading taxes rather than giving back.I'm not so sure that's true.  The ultra-rich actually donate a huge amount of money.  Just last July a Saudi Prince announced he was donating over $30 billion to \"philanthropic causes\".  And back in 2012 a bunch of them pledged to give away \"half their wealth.\"And those are just a couple of the bigger examples I found in 2 minutes of web search.Also, I've never heard of anybody volunteering to pay more taxes.

(Another way of expressing that comes to mind, but I'm not sure how to spell 'jackhammer').The source is presumably the numbers in there:\nhttp://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/t...\nmatched with the corresponding internet adoption in those countries at the same time. The parallel is discutable, expressly so.Full disclosure:\nI tried and wasn\u2019t able to match those numbers myself (with internal ressources, when I was working for Fb); I would strongly encourage anyone curious to go through the methodology notes: there are many things that deserves to be discussed around equality, literacy, institutional change. Basically, things that are looked at independently by the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) and the Society for Institutional & Organizational Economics (SIOE, formerly ISNIE). Neither institution have been involved in that estimation as far as I can tell \u2014 and they would have tremendous impact on the nuanced understanding of those forces once they do.I believe that Facebook can have a dramatic impact on emerging markets, especially with their advertising platform; I know personally who works on measuring that, and I know it is too early to have a proper macroeconomic estimation \u2014 but the impact should be very encouraging: there are many places where you cannot grow your business easily.In the meantime, I would take that argument as:\nMark Zuckerberg wants Facebook, Internet.org and internet access in general to lift people out of poverty and into jobs. That means that arguments that argue against his efforts that involve negative effects less than a tenth of \u201cbeing about to feed their family\u201d will seem quaint to him. Measuring all impacts into orders of magnitude like that can seem a heartless exercice to many, but should not feel foreign to a regular reader of HackerNews.On the other hand, this also means that efforts that connect internet technology with finding or creating jobs should have MZ\u2019s undying support (modulo a possible ad fee).What I believe is more interesting are things like:\nDoes Internet favour local commerce or international transactions? (Unclear)\nAre devices and platform used for business similar to those used for personal transaction? (Apparently, yes.)\nWill West Africa still be ruled by Mama Benz's, even with widespread adoption the smartphone? (Three forces cannot be stopped in this universe: Death, taxes and Mama Benz's dressing up on Sunday. Samsung better adapt.)",

This is very effective writing and may change someone's opinion from emotional calls. It's very human, easy to understand and people flock to it.However; we have seen the constant and repeated abuse of using this style of writing. Advertisements are the most prominent and politics the most dystopian. It's also very easy to convince people that certain things are facts when that may be disputed or outright wrong.So there's a weird question to come out of this: how accurate and cited do we really need our emotional appeals to be? Given the effectiveness of the writing, citations seem completely unnecessary. Given the context (letter to child; although I'm fairly certain it was orignially intended for a broader audience this is what they claim) you would assume it has no need to be entirely factual, but that context is changed now that it's become a public letter. A public piece of writing should ethically cite or have some backing for any statistics they claim (in my opinion). Although overall hacker news' culture would probably say that if you make a decision, it should probably be based on real data.Personally, I think it's a piece of writing meant for a wide audience which in my opinion means they should cite any claims they make in this case.

Every time the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation does something, we don't get dozens of people rising out of the woodwork harping on Microsoft's unethical business practices - but Bill Gates' mid-90s Microsoft was definitely on par with Facebook at its worst. It's okay to celebrate good things done, as long as we don't fully forget how we got there. We should continue to criticize Facebook as a company even as we recognize that the individual here is attempting something great.> Finally, using the pretense of writing a letter to their newly born daughter rubs some the wrong way.It's a pretty easy and effective rhetorical device. The letter is obviously targeted at the world, or he wouldn't have published it. But it's a good way to present some emotional framing - this is why he cares so much, why he's invested in a better world.

If it isn't built yet, it must be because we're not working hard and fast enough. That if someone has billions of dollars, and are just willing to fund an initiative, they can take credit for curing all disease.Part of it is the fear that's faced by people who felt invincible when they become old, or have a newborn infant.

The world is indifferent.  At that point, you are simply a rich person.once you reach such an inflection point of wealth, you must find an alternative means of increasing your social capital.  there are two common ways: one is to demonstrate your evolutionary fitness in a field completely unrelated to how you amassed your wealth: many rich get into movie production, novel writing or other creative endeavor.  These usually fail.another alternative, the safer alternative, is to expend your remaining time and resources advancing social causes (running for an elected office certainly falls under this category).  this is the simplest way for an adult, untrained in anything other than their primary business, to increase their social capital.it's not a coincidence that zuck is still willing $450mm to his offspring--more than enough to hit that inflection point.  he knows that any additional dollar beyond that inflection point provides marginal social value to his offspring.",

These arguments are more likely to be persuasive to politicians - both left and right. This is a lesson I believe the general public missed  after the whole Occupy movement failed to result in much political change. The problem with the obsessive focus on \"the 1%\" was that it generated an us vs them response, further entrenching positions on both sides and further distancing already strained policial/social group relationships.For example: the simplification of taxes would very likely increasing the speed at which people file taxes and therefore signficantly increasing the speed that tax revenue could be collected annually, while reducing the amount of time they spend chasing down people who fail to do taxes. <- These are the types of a-political positive benefits I hope will eventually get attention one day to make the previously mentioned policies less of a pipe dream.",

The Internet and thus Facebook wouldn't exist without billions of taxpayer investment in early stage high risk research and procurement via DARPA and other government agencies. That continues today (just a couple examples: Siri and autonomous vehicles).If we are serious about accomplishing social change and \"long term investments over 25, 50 or even 100 years,\" the answers lie in greater government investment in these areas. Just like Silicon Valley. And that means all Silicon Valley companies should be paying back to the government just as they would an early stage investor. Not as a \"noble choice\" but as an obligation. (Currently they get the core tech pretty much for free.)

They think everyone in the future will adopt the same worldview that they have. They think that they can solve poverty by giving everyone an Internet connection on the planet and most people who are poor are illiterate and can't read and write.Like I said a lot of promises.Some problems can't be solved with money, it takes innovation, it takes a new way of thinking, it takes doing things in a way nobody thought of yet.Students who are poor and have family problems have emotional and psychological problems that hinder their learning. No matter how much money you spend on their school, as Gates has learned, their test scores don't go up.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/...This effort by the Gates Foundation proves that building better schools does not give the students a better education.You see they made the mistake of throwing money at a problem in order to solve it. Five years later and a disappointment in what they had created.Parents of the students get by with low paying jobs, because there is a wealth inequality in our nation. It leads to poverty, family issues, emotional and psychological problems none of which building new schools could address. All of which factor into having a hard time learning and getting better test scores.Why is there a wealth inequality and people have to settle for low paying jobs?Technology has automated most of the good paying jobs so they can be done with computers for free. Microsoft and Facebook for example earn money from technology that does work for others for free and earns money. Websites can operate 24/7 and replace people who take phone calls or work at a desk to fill out forms.Also we used to have factory jobs until we shipped those jobs to China because the labor cost less over there.Getting a good education is only possible if you have a good enough credit rating to get a student loan, if your family is poor and struggles and misses paying bills, you will have a bad credit rating and not be able to get a student loan for college. Not getting good enough grades will lead to a lack of scholarships and other things.People who can't get a college education face a life of hardship working low paying jobs just to get by. Not everyone can become a computer programmer after being a dropout, and then join a startup. Some have to work retail jobs in the service industry and 2 or 3 of those jobs. Not having time to raise their children properly. Not able to help with homework because they work overtime to get enough money to pay the bills.These factors have not been addressed in the future plans for fixing our education system.Sure you can learn a lot on the Internet and even use it to earn money, but most people just use it for entertainment value and communication. So there are distractions to learning on the Internet. But what happens when the freelance market suddenly gets 3 billion more lower wage contractors in it all competing for the limited amount of contracts?I wish I knew how to solve these problems, but I learned from experience that you can't just throw money at them and solve them.You need the government to help out with some sort of basic income program to lift people out of poverty as good paying jobs are scarce because of automation or AI advances. I expect that to get worse in the future.You need better mental health clinics to address the emotional and psychological problems associated with poverty for the students to be able to learn better. You need to find money for tutors to help them with homework when their parents cannot. You need to teach poor students stress management and test anxiety management so that they can o better in tests and learn better study habits and score higher.I've found at least with my son, that the Internet is a distraction for him. Time he could have spent studying for tests, he instead watches Youtube videos and plays video games. I've tried to help him as best as I can, but now he is failing chemistry as a junior in high school but passing his other classes because they are not as hard.We are one of those poor families because I ended up on disability in 2003 and don't earn as much as I used to as a programmer. There is only so much I can help my son, he makes decisions for himself, but I cannot force him to study more or do better on his tests. I feel as if I didn't go on disability we'd be better off and I'd be able to hire a chemistry tutor for him to get his grades up. I forgot as I took chemistry in 1985, and it was so long ago. It is harder to raise a child than you think, esp if you are on a limited income. The school he goes to is a good one with good teachers and modern equipment and they use iPads for ebooks and learning, but it is not enough and still students struggle with their classes.No matter what you do there will still be problems as no system is perfect, and students will still get low mtest grades no matter how good a personalized system you develop. The Dewey System was developed for personalized learning and it failed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_DeweyMost of what they are trying to do has already been tried and failed. It is like trying to go against human nature and change the way human beings behave so they can learn better. But human beings cannot be reprogrammed like robots, and almost all of these theories go with the case that human beings can be reprogrammed like robots to create a better community for better learning.It is like trying to solve a social problem using technology thinking, you need to think in terms of society and the way people work, which is not the same way technology works. You need to lead social reforms in communities in a way that makes sense to everybody and not just people on a certain political spectrum that leaves out all others. You will face a resistance to change, as many won't want to change. People will come up with conspiracy theories over the changes, etc.It is a good start to build a different system of education and try to make new communities for education for everyone, but money alone won't solve it, you need the cooperation of everyone in the community to change the way their human nature works and give up on the old ways of doing things. Some won't want to give up on the old ways.",

Last time I glanced through the agreement, Facebook is just trying to avoid paying for HD photos and video downloads, which would increase the cost of Internet.org beyond feasibility.An initiative can be charitable while also benefiting the donor. The users of Internet.org get free access to Facebook as well as the other services being provided and that doesn't detract from the service or make the whole initiative evil.I have yet to see research that providing a zero-rating service is harmful as you suggest.[1]: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internet-org",

Instead, you get stuff like:\"In order for your content to be proxied as described above, your URLs may be re-written and embedded content (like javascript and content originating from another domain) removed. In addition, secure content is not supported and may not load.\" [1]Let's be absolutely clear here: Facebook wants to control what content gets into Free Basics and how it's presented, and is willing to make security impossible in order to do it. This enables both censorship and mass surveillance controlled by Facebook and whoever is willing to pay them.>  The users of Internet.org get free access to Facebook as well as the other services being provided and that doesn't detract from the service or make the whole initiative evil.It's not the things users get access to that I'm worried about, it's the things they don't get access to, and who else gets access to those user's data.[1] https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internet-org/participat...",

By gifting stock, he can gift a far greater amount and the tax-exempt recipient charity can sell the stock itself to raise cash.  This is standard in situations like this - e.g. it's what Buffett did when gifting away almost all of his billions.Also the cause you listed is just one of many that he is gifting to so you're missing the forest for the trees.  To help overcome this, list all of the good causes he mentioned (personalized learning, curing disease etc), then list the ones that you don't like.  I bet the list of good causes will be far longer than the list of ones you don't like.",

They will invest in companies, lobby for legislation and seek to influence public policy debates, which nonprofits are restricted from doing under tax laws.

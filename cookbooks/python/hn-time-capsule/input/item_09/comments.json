In some ways, `align-content` will always imply a certain \"bunching\" to the children (they are either stuck to the start, end, center or spaced evenly in some manner - but never changing order, wrap or size), whereas `align-items` changes how lone-items behave in the flow, be it start, end, center or some stretching).These two URLs provide some decent visual demos & distinction:https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/align-content/\nhttps://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/align-items/",

Yale and New Haven police had responded to noise complaints at the party, and brothers were told not to let anyone else in, to avoid crowding.

That seems to be worth studying, yet no one seems to be doing it.I think there are fairly straightforward explanations, simply deducing from books I've read about urban crime... Most crime is intra-racial because it occurs between people who know each other or live near each other and tends to be concentrated in areas of poverty which tend to be demographically homogeneous. Overall, blacks commit crimes at higher rates than whites, which partially correlates with higher poverty rates, but it's not distributed equally because it's also highly concentrated among small numbers of urban street gangs/groups who commit enormous amounts of crime (of which there's no poor white rural counterpart). These groups are mostly surrounded by blacks, so most of their victims will be black, but there are enough whites near them that the whites who are victims of these groups contribute to the black-on-white numbers being higher. Part of the irrationality and bigotry comes from interpreting these numbers as some kind of targeting going on specifically to whites because there's no reverse equivalent instead of understanding that it actually comes from an urban dynamic that overall causes black victims to suffer even more than whites.",

Should they all be terrified of white people?  Probably not.So the situation in the data is more complicated than the white supremacists would care to admit.But more importantly, people's perception of safety is not a direct reflection of the data, but instead, a reflection of the way the data is presented, either by the mass media, or by choose-your-own-agenda websites like the kind you linked.It also tends to be heavily skewed for the local crime situation in which they live, rather than national crime stats.",

I may, perhaps, use risk of violence per minute of exposure as my metric.It immediately becomes obvious that the publicly-available published crime statistics are useless for my purposes.  They do not contain sufficient information to allow me to determine how much more or less likely I am to be attacked by a person of a given skin color for each minute of exposure to that person in public.  I would have to know detailed social habits for everyone within the crime statistic reporting area.It may be that for every 100000 opportunities to punch someone in the face, the conversion rate is higher for one skin color than for another, and I should therefore rationally calibrate my fear accordingly.

You said:  > You are 4 times more likely to be violently attacked by\n  > a white person than a black person, if you are a white person.\n\nAnd this does not follow from the previous paragraph.  Given a randomly selected white person who was attacked in the last year, it is 4 times more likely that the attacker was white than black.  Manipulating that conditional probability to find the ratio of probabilities that a randomly selected white person was attacked by a white person compared with a randomly selected white person being attacked by a black person requires additional Bayesian calculations that you did not perform.

The authors concluded that these flaws make it \"highly likely that the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is underestimating rape and sexual assault.\"[5] The NCVS also differs from other studies by including off campus students among its statistics. Since the risk of assault is higher for students living on campus, the 0.6% reported assault rate is lower than rates reported for campus environments.",

But feeling comfortable isn't always a good thing.Pain from working out isn't a bad thing, it's actually a sign of something good, but many people avoid it.  Pain from a beating is bad for two reasons, it strikes both the physical body and the emotional psyche of the recipient.I think this is at the core of why people want to get rid of emotional damage, they don't realize that some pain teaches, and some harms.  Something my football coach used to say to us.  If you are hurt, get up and keep going.  If you are injured you better get off of my field and rest.The same is true for emotional damage.  Some hurts but is good for you, and other injures a person.  It is a thin line to tread but I think we are well past the point where people are mistaking hurt for injury.",

We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured. But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\" Was not Amos an extremist for justice: \"Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.\" Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: \"I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.\" Was not Martin Luther an extremist: \"Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God.\" And John Bunyan: \"I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.\" And Abraham Lincoln: \"This nation cannot survive half slave and half free.\" And Thomas Jefferson: \"We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal . . .\" So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?",

They have been for centuries. The only thing that has changed is that people with privilege, on rare occasion, can no longer say certain things without any consequence.As Popehat writes, freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences. There's an important question of what consequences should or can legitimately flow from speech. But when this \"people shouldn't be scared to express opinions\" line gets trotted out only to defend white guys, it's a tell. The nominal principle might be freedom of speech, but if the only people defended are the privileged, the actual principle is maintenance of societal privilege.",

As I mentioned, I am addressing the line of argument, not the case.What I amsaying is that when the \"freedom of speech\" flag only gets hauled out for pro-bigotry straight white guys, I think it's not really about freedom of speech but instead  defense of privilege. If defenders of free speech want to convince me they're serious, they'll be just as vigorous in defending unpopular opinions of people not in their demographic.That may even be you, in which case, congrats. But unlike you, I don't think it's unconditionally bad that some people are afraid to express opinions because they may face social consequences for them. E.g., if some of the Donald Sterlings of the world are now afraid to express their bigotry, that's ok by me. And if some people are afraid to publish something because they aren't sure whether or not it's bigoted, I also have a hard time seeing that as bad. That seems like a fine opportunity for them to consider their opinions before publishing them.In fact, I think that's what most people do. The only thing that's different is that straight white guys now have to do the same sort of self-managing that everybody else has always done, because they're now slightly less insulated from the consequences of their actions.",

My apology if not totally clear, but the jist of what I'm getting at is my impression of cultural studies is that the inherent inclusiveness of 'perspectives' doesn't really challenge students, but predominately allows an arena for affirmation. I suppose what I mean is that based on the nature of the subject matter, an excellent rhetorical essay framing genocide of a certain culture can't really be criticized as 'bad thinking' if the structuring of the argument and included reasoning are sound, though the very concept itself is abhorrent in its premise.",

We had all heard of isolated incidents of intolerance in the news, and had the sense that such sheltered students could be found on campus, but we didn't personally know or associate with anyone who could be so extreme or intolerant in their beliefs. Which caused us to ask: how does a student like this get a spot at a decent university? Who raises their child to be so intolerant?So I have to disagree with your claim that such intolerant and childish comments \"[smell] very much like what students today are saying.\" There is a vocal minority of students who say and do things that do not represent the larger body of students as a whole. There always will be. The average college student is still too busy meeting people, playing sports, dating, drinking, traveling, doing internships, interviewing for jobs, and (occasionally) going to lectures to make a big fuss out of anything that might offend him/her.",

Formal debate is about the art of rhetoric, and explicitly part of the expectation - and the skill taught - is the deliberate distortion/reframing of fact in order to support your case. Anyone who's done formal debates will have learned this, since you're frequently asked to argue positions you personally disagree with.Formal debate is a craft of being convincing, not of being right.Not to mention the structure of formal debates means there is a winner and a loser, and so compromise is impossible. The goal isn't to reach an understanding or middle ground, but to completely obliterate your opponent rhetorically. This fits poorly with real life.",

        "text": "\"respond to someone being wrong\"I believe this might be your bone of contention.  The speech was a mission statement, more or less, with an introduction that is very catchy and exciting and clickbaity, but overall irrelevant to the main argument.  This is not a response of right or wrong.  Obviously the leader thinks people who oppose him are wrong, but the main thrust of the argument past that intro is \"where is what we are going to do here\".For example, obviously a long cultural time ago, although it was only a bit more than a decade, all the seniors at the school I finally graduated from (I was a part timer) took the same giant Holocaust class.  It was a required interdisciplinary liberal arts survey class, of a topic that changed every year.  I believe they had \"death\" as the topic another year.  They were obviously kind of a downer phase.  For cultural change reasons they don't do this anymore, which is a shame.  Anyway the point of an interdisciplinary liberal arts class isn't to debate philosophically if the topic is right or wrong, but to teach the students how to actually apply the full spectrum of liberal arts, all of them, because you're all well rounded individuals now, to a topic.Someone who disliked the idea of confronting a rather foreign culture and world view could fight against the class by demanding that you're not allowed to respond to the Holocaust intellectually unless you can first express Hitler's position in a way that modern Nazis would agree accurately represents their view.  Why yes I did just \"Godwin\" you.  But of course that logic is total bunk.  The real purpose of the class is to teach the students how to observe then analyze the inter-related whole of the topic, across multiple disciplines.  That requires application of intellectual skills, not right or wrong judgments.  You don't need to express agreement with the text of mein kampf to see how the economic situation dovetailed with the political situation dovetailed with the cultural situation etc.  My term paper was how architecture related to the other liberal arts in the reich WRT to propaganda and scale and form etc.Really the only reason why they gave us the Holocaust as a study topic was to scare the hell out of us, if we fail to learn the skills of cross disciplinary observation, analysis, and synthesis skills taught in the class, maybe something that bad will happen again.  Now for over sensitivity reasons, or more likely profound lack of courage, we can't get that reward, can't learn to avoid evil by intellectual analysis.  That opens a whole nother can of worms where the campus is now a safe space free of gas chamber triggering, but the whole country overall is far less of a safe space, because the current grads are emotionally coddled, less intellectually skilled, and far more cowardly unless acting in mob actions.  Luckily mob action historically has always been effective and rational, correct?  And we can make up for personal cowardice with more drone strikes, correct?  And the politician that proposes the simplest sounding solution is probably the best because we no longer have the intellectual rigor to analyze, correct?  I mean, what could possibly go wrong?",

I realize you are not saying safe spaces should not exist. Instead I want to make the argument that having safe spaces is reasonable.People make safe spaces _within_ universities and other institutions for the same reason some combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder put up signs asking neighbors not to set off fireworks[0]. It is to avoid triggering people that have have experienced serious trauma[1].For instance using the combat veteran example, it would be unreasonable for a veteran to attend a fireworks show and then complain about the fireworks, but if this same combat veteran was attending University and it would be reasonable to ask the University to provide a safe space away from fireworks or other triggers -- sound proofed dorms if students are constantly setting off fireworks.There is a big difference in intention between 'safety from conflicting points of view' and safe spaces. Although a safe space sometimes requires limiting certain discussions (a person who was sexuality assaulted might be triggered by discussions and depictions of sexual assault).[0]: http://www.militarywithptsd.org/fireworks-triggers-ptsd-and-...[1]: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-...",

And so on.\"Although a safe space sometimes requires limiting certain discussions\"\nThat makes no sense in a university IMHO. Students could be excused of classes due to previous traumatic experiences, not the other way around.No discussion should be silenced because the topic triggers or bothers someone. Sure, we can be sensitive about it, and take precautionary measures (warn the students in advance of the topic, etc.), but at absolutely no point, IMHO, should a discussion in an university be limited because it bothers, annoys, disrespects or triggers someone.Yes, that opens room for some awful, violent and disrespectful points of view, but so many pillars of modern society were once those same awful, violent and disrespectful POVs.",

You provide a mix of comprehensive support of different types to students; you promote a culture of inclusion an sharing in that room.Suicide is really important.  It's the leading cause of death of men aged between 15 and 49 in the UK.  Rates are increasing.  NHS cuts mean it's harder to get good quality support. Appropriately talking about suicide probably doesn't raise risk, and may well lower risk.So, it's a shame that this topic got cut from the syllabus.There are other examples in this thread of law students not learning about rape law because it's too distressing to hear.That shows a misunderstanding of what PTSD survivors want when they talk about trigger warnings.  The point is not \"I should be able to live my life and avoid every mention of this thing that causes me significant distress\", but \"I am currently vulnerable, but getting support, and I need a little bit of warning not so I can avoid the subject, but so that I can make sure I have the little bit of extra support I need to keep me safe\".However: the people on the other side are mostly fucking hateful cunts who scream \"What about my freedom of speech?\" while seeking to silence the people they're screaming at.",

You used to need to find a group of people to hang out with in your area and in doing so you'd associate with the social norms of that group, whatever they may be.Now you craft your friend's list on Facebook with people who agree with you and reinforce you. If you've ever clicked the \"unfollow\" button you're guilty of this. This reinforcement leads to an echo chamber.As a culture, we're effectively putting canvasing over logic and reason in all areas. That's essentially what you get from a social feed that reinforces your views - constant news that agrees with you...which is just canvasing yourself.Canvasing feeds on feelings and reaction over reason. You look at just about any socially convenient topic and you'll see this. Just as an example, let's look at diversity in tech since this is Hacker News.We're more than willing to accost the entire industry for lack of diversity as if it's somehow their fault. Yet most of these companies are falling all over themselves to hire people and we aren't hearing stories about discrimination or people not getting jobs...we just see the numbers and assume something is wrong.We're not allowed to consider that people might tend to just be wired a certain way. Men's brains work differently than women's. Certain problems might be interesting to certain types of people and not to other.Instead we create a cause and a problem that must be fixed immediately.

Dabbling in politics was seen as an unwomanly thing ladies should be spared from.Not unlike how people today think that the scarcity of women in tech is due to them naturally having less interest in it. It's easy to ascribe the status quo to the natural order of things.Of writing of that era I like \"Are Women People?\"[1] It's written from a suffragettes point of view, but it includes some cherry-picked quotes from anti-suffragists, such as:\"The grant of suffrage to women is repugnant to instincts that strike their roots deep in the order of nature.

The minorities who have been revealing systemic bias, bigotry, and racism at these universities are the students who started and sustain the current protests.Do not conflate the cause of those fighting against campus racism, bigotry, and bias with those who seek to shut down the the process of learning at the sign of the tiniest challenging or upsetting idea.

I think this is somewhat missing the point, but I can relate to it. I feel like this is the dominant narrative in this thread.But the narrative in the article seems to be: \"if something makes you uncomfortable, good! It's because you're a bad person. You should be a better person instead of asking us to tell you you're not bad\".And I pretty strongly disagree with that.For example, if the sermon was all about how gay people are going to hell, and that made a student uncomfortable, that's not because the student is a bad person. That's because it was a terrible sermon.From the description, this sermon was not obviously terrible. But that still doesn't make the student a bad person. Not everyone experiences or expresses emotions in the same ways. That's fine. When people start speaking about experiences as if they're human universals, and if you don't share those experiences, that can make you uncomfortable. That's fine too.

It says actions/qualities (or that most of life, actually) is meaningless, nothing, without love (as an attachment to God/Truth)Second, it defines what is definitely not \"love\", so one may not use it as a pretext for wrong doing (at least).Third, it says that we will never see things fully, neither at once, until, that is, the end (provided it's not an ellipsis, he! :) ).Plus, \"love\" as expressed in this text is not Philia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philia) but from Latin Caritas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_%28virtue%29) (or Greek \"agape\"); which is not about a feeling, but about something way deeper, transcendant and, although not quite the right word, respectful, for one to an other. It's love as one of the three Christian theological virtues (fides, spes, caritas), that is, in an intimate relation to the Christian God (in this context) as a guide, a goal, an ideal for love/Philia too.> That love is genuine, and it doesn't redeem the action.I see your point. That love is, actually, deeply misled. Actually, that's not love, that's fear that supersedes love (\"I fear that you [x] and I don't want to because this makes me [y] and I freak out and I don't think you can decide for yourself, so I'll do it and [z]\").Love (be it eros, philia or even agape) is no excuse to abuse.

I suspect that attendance at sermons is required at Oklahoma Wesleyan, and I further suspect that students are strongly discouraged from publicly espousing views contrary to the content of those sermons.

I've argued against the premise of 2 (which the OP did make); if you have a more deontological worldview, you might want to frame this as the student's \"own fault\" for not realizing, but I generally don't blame people for being dumb (in the sense of insisting on them bearing the consequences of being dumb), instead asking which course of action yields the best consequences. In this case, if we assume informed freedom of association is a value, then adding information is a benefit.3 would be a good defense if done well, but again, isn't the OP. It would actually be the best example of \"I'm not a jerk\"-type answers. But it's not immediately obvious how we can view something that bothered someone as not harming them. At best, you'd probably need to invoke Christian beliefs and go back to \"informed consent\" as above.

While the article may (or may not be, I really have no idea) a fabrication, my observation is that the sentiment towards playing the victim and labeling others as haters and bigots is extensive.Being brought up Christian, I also have no argument that many of the \"Christian\" religions, Catholicism in particular, do seem to favour guilt as the tool of choice to manipulate their congregations into toeing the line - it's one of the many reasons I shunned the church at a fairly young age. I have no interest in spending my life feeling guilty for not living up to an unreasonable expectation of a collection of long dead ancestors that have little (if any) bearing on today's society. What happened to just treating others as you wish to be treated in return?There is guilt on both sides of this argument and neither one can stop to address their own shortcomings before judging the other.On the other hand, I have little to argue with the content of the article. If you're not equipped to deal with how the world around you treats you, you will forever be playing the victim card. Is that what you really want for your whole life? or are you ready to take charge of yourself, responsibility for your own emotions and behaviour? or would you prefer to be treated as a child for the rest of your life, protected from reality by 'yes' men, validating you because you haven't learned to deal with your feelings of a lack of validation?Nobody ever accomplished anything without dealing with the discomfort of the world around them.",

    "text": "Interesting read - there's a lot of back and forth between the so-called SJWs and the anti-PC crowd and it's becoming reminiscent of every generational battle I've listened to in my life.Every adult has screamed about the \"Next Generation\" being softer or not as capable as the current.  I think it's a lack of adults remembering how they were when they were young.  I'm \"Gen X\", the naming of which was often (incorrectly) attributed to aimlessness: \"The Unknown Generation\" (the real naming reason has a much less arrogant reason).I am concerned about the seeming \"addiction to Victimhood\" that appears[1] to be plaguing generations below me, however, I'm about as concerned about it as I would be any trivial thing.  Success (however it's defined) requires one to figure out how to navigate the perceived injustices and figure out how to carve out a life. We did; they will, too. Hopefully it'll happen without a bunch of new legislation under the guise of Justice but with the result of further erosion of freedom.There's one, key, difference between today's screaming and the screaming of generations past: Reach.  Just like the current crop of over-protective parents dreaming that crime is so much worse these days than it was when we were kids (when in reality many crimes against children occur with half the frequency they did when we were young), the screaming about injustice is much more visible.  This serves two negative purposes: we perceive that the entire generation of kids is a bunch of weak, whining losers based on a handful of folks with extreme positions and those striving for an identity see an opportunity to jump on the large (again, perceived) bandwagon and get some attention.  Everyone has an opportunity to be heard and it's up to each of us to set our filters appropriately.  Unfortunately, Critical Thinking is something that is often absent or ignored[2].[1] \"Appears\" being the operative word.  Though I've read many articles, I tend to surround myself with people who fit the age-range and socioeconomic status of the typical Victimhood addict and I don't see any of these traits in them.  Anecdote, yes, but so many of the news stories are based on little more evidence.[2] That sounds like a dig; it's not meant to be.  I believe Critical Thinking is a fancy way of saying \"wisdom\" and is something that is acquired through experience, is rarely teachable (if it's even attempted to be taught) and is often forgotten in the face of highly-emotional arguments.  It's the sort of thing that changes the phrase \"Founders with heavy accents are rarely in the top 100 start-ups\" into \"I think people who don't speak English are dumb\".  Over time, and with experience at your back, you (hopefully) learn to be slow to ascribe malice to another's actions and give people the benefit of the doubt.  Everyone communicates differently and I think most of us intend the best, not the worst.",

A public letter like this from the university President is appropriate for a broad issue that goes beyond someone raising a personal complaint (which this letter provides no hint of), such as a public controversy directed at the university.Given the scenario the letter itself lays out, the act of responding by such a public letter is at least as childish, thin-skinned, and inappropriate for a university environment where all participants (especially the administration) are supposed to be adults as the complaint it describes.And given the specific subject of the complaint and response, it really sounds like the author could do with some of their own reflection on 1 Cor 13:4-5.

You do not have a right not to hear ideas you don't agree with, because if such a right existed in a world with such diverse opinions, no one could ever open their mouth. Censorship of opposing ideas carries a very real and very significant cost which I believe outweighs, by orders of magnitude, any perceived benefits. The real world doesn't come with trigger warnings pasted on every surface and prefacing every human interaction, and I think neither should a university.Obviously there are shades of gray depending on the particular speech, and we've collectively drawn a line around certain speech (call it \"hate speech\") which we do believe should be censored. Otherwise, the correct response to speech you don't agree with is more speech ideally in the form of reasoned and well-informed debate of the issues.What I find the most perplexing is how, in many cases it seems like the original speech which was deemed offensive or victimizing, which typically itself was not even directed at the \"victim\", is answered in return with extreme prejudice and hate directly aimed at the original speaker. This can also be combined with a social media campaign to attempt to politicize the whole event and inflict maximum damage. This is why I am often confused as to who is the real victim in these cases.The ad blocker analogy is interesting. Even blocking ads is somewhat contentious  (e.g. lawsuits against DVRs with 30-second skip buttons, site owners saying their revenue stream has been decimated, etc.) and this is simply users controlling what their own devices are doing! Blocking an ad might deprive a site of revenue, but it doesn't deprive anyone else of their voice -- no one is being censored.You say we surely allow people to shovel words into our brains... Hearing speech you don't like is one thing, but what about someone else taking their own inability to function in a diverse culture, and using it to dictate the words anyone who happens to be around them are allowed to speak? This sounds like a case where the medicine is worse than the disease.The biggest problem with \"safe spaces\" is that they are not actually limited to small rooms in the student union with play-dough and elevator music, but I think a lot of people are very concerned that the intent is ultimately for the entire campus to be policed like one. And I do mean policed, because stepping afoul of the mythical safe space code of conduct is taken as a capital offense, to which you may see literal rioting in response.",

Certainly my right to speak should not trump your right to not have to be listen.I think that the galling part about the safe space thing is that people are going to places which are designed to be not safe (in that sense) and then demanding everyone stop doing what they came there to do. It's like walking into a bar and proclaiming \"I'm an alcoholic and you're all harming me by drinking in front of me!\" That's stupid.

A sound basic understanding of the chemistry of life.2. A sound basic understanding of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structure and function.3. A fundamental knowledge of Classical, Molecular, and Population genetics.4. A sound basic understanding of the proposed mechanisms  of evolution and understanding of Creation.5. A sound basic understanding of the structure and function in plants and animals.6. A sound basic understanding of ecology.7. Integration of the Biblical Principles into life sciences.Needless to say, I'm not surprised by the \"framing\" of Evolution and, essentially, equivocating its merit with, um, Biblical Creationism.",

I agree in opposing those, but it's a separate issue.) A safe space is nothing more than a \"free and voluntary association of like-minded people.\"",

What's interesting is I don't think the goal of these \"safe spaces\" is at all to foster \"free discussion\" or \"open development of ideas\". What you see people rallying against is that the SJWs are shutting down any free discussion through these tactics.For example, these \"safe spaces\" apparently are to protect against \"micro-aggressions\" (a term I only recently learned) which if I understand correctly means to \"take offense where none was given\" aka to put words into someone's mouth? So now it's not even what someone is saying but how someone in the audience might feel, because of their own personal history, indirectly because a word the speaker used. And this is the speaker's responsibility now that someone in the audience was made to feel this way because they were confronted with a disagreeing opinion?I think this is where the accusations of mollycoddling come in. It sounds like these kids aren't ready for serious academic discourse. They're stuck in a world where there is only one \"right\" and they paint caractures of their racist and bigoted antagonists to support their view.What I find noxious is warfangle's claim that we must all be sexist and bigots to raise questions around academic freedom and censorship in colleges / universities... I think this is a typical parlor trick to try to shut down productive discussion. Frankly I would have liked to see a rebuke from dang in response. Why is it ok to attack a group saying a viewpoint is \"disgustingly indicative of the inherent sexism and flat-out hatred that worms its way through developer culture.\" All the same, I'll let warfangle speak for themself and I don't expect HN to be free from dissenting opinions or even vitriol. Because in an attempt to shut down a \"narrow and combative approach\" it's impossible not to have a chilling effect on the overall discussion. In your safe spaces you might be spared from some of the bad, but it comes at a significant cost to others around you who aren't triggered and are capable of having adult conversations on difficult topics.Frankly I've been waiting for an article like this to hit the front page because I am very interested in seeing the varying perspectives and actually having a chance at productive conversation on HN, which you won't find in the comments anywhere else that's for sure!",

It's obvious that everyone present is of like-mind, and those who are there for purposes other than discussion of the topic at hand can be expelled through social means as a consensus action of the group without any need for authority involvement.Meanwhile, I often hear the term \"safe space\" used by people when they want to take over a shared space to insulate themselves from people who might disagree with them or maybe even be bigots towards them, while in public.  I am not in any way arguing that bigotry is socially acceptable, but it is protected speech, and while it is perfectly appropriate to tell people that their bigotry is offensive, inappropriate, and unwelcome, it's not appropriate to ask that an authority come in and forcibly establish a zone in a shared space where-in some speech is okay and other speech is not.My opinion, which I think is largely in-line with the person you replied to, is not one born out of hatred or bigotry, it's born out of concern about the death of dissent.  It's a concern that our culture is shifting to one where everyone lives in an echo chamber and is intolerant of any ideas not of their own making.  It is perfectly acceptable as a society to be intolerant of intolerance, and that includes both intolerance based in bigotry as well as intolerance based in delusion.  This is not an argument in favor of people \"just taking it\" when others behave in inappropriate ways towards them, but it is a plea for reason around dissent. Respectful disagreement is not offensive or inappropriate, even though some people may use disrespectful terms in their dissent which themselves are offensive or inappropriate, that does not mean that all people who disagree are inherently offensive.  It is not oppression to disagree with someone, it is oppression to prevent dissenting opinions.Given that so much of the influence and respect people in the public eye have these days is based on the appearance that they're socially/politically appropriate, it's very clear how claims of victimhood can be used to intimidate.  In some cases, I don't have much sympathy for those who have come under fire since they are in a position to clearly state their position and walk away relatively unscathed, but some people unfortunately are not in that situation.  Take for instance, the two Yale professors who clearly argued for school administrators to allow students to define their own standards and for students to have a discussion, instead were reviled unfairly by some students who instead want administrators to use their authority to impose speech controls.  Unfortunately, those Yale professors have less influence with which to save themselves than the administrators who more often come under fire.Perhaps the most confusing thing to me about this whole situation is that in most cases the people calling for \"safe spaces\" are people who are part of marginalized groups or are saying that they act on behalf of marginalized groups.  The social concepts surrounding free association, free speech, and dissent are there to protect marginalized groups.  It allows them to exist, gather, and discuss their ideas, thoughts, experiences, and feelings and to publicly disagree with people who are in the majority groups and be protected from the oppression of being silenced by authority while doing so.  It seems strange to me that the people claiming to be proponents of marginalized groups would want to take away these protections from anyone.I could write more, but I don't think it would lend anything else to the point I'm trying to make.  If anyone reading this is unable to understand the difference between free association of like-minded people in private spaces vs trying to enforce speech controls on everyone, including those who may not be like-minded, in a shared space, and why the latter might be concerning to many for reasons that do not originate from any personal hatred or bigotry, I will attempt to clarify further.  Otherwise, I hope the above is well-stated enough to put forward that position.",

In fact, I don't even see why this would eventually lead itself to be true, unless you already consider bigotry and hatred to be the majority norm in a very pervasive sense. I could write more on the matter, but others have done some considerable study on the matter [1]. I would say that overall being tolerant of intolerance is a good thing, because these people naturally exclude themselves from social structures and circles of power where they are expected to maintain a leadership role towards those they are bigoted against. Further, by integrating intolerant people with those of us who are tolerant, there is more chance for them to learn why their hatred may be misplaced, and for us to learn where the boundaries of our own personal expression should be.Thinking merely that we must \"stamp out all hatred\" is in fact a form of hatred in itself.

I am in no way advocating that it is okay to discriminate against or harass people based on their identity.  Speech can be an action, but it can also just be speech.  It's not a simple line, but I think it's well defined in the law and well understood in society the difference between a statement of opinion, which may or may not be bigoted, and harassment.Also, I'd like to point out that you're awfully focused on my statements around bigotry.  Bigotry is a consequence of humanity, but it's also something that can be changed through education and discussion.  The very reason why it's important to protect dissenting speech, is because it's a protection for society against bigotry.  The movement that's currently happening around \"safe spaces\" is not merely a reaction to bigotry, it's also a reaction to dissenting opinions, ignoring the latter for the former because the former makes an easy target to argue against due to its inappropriateness and unpopularity does not change the facts of the matter.I think part of our misunderstanding is that we disagree on what is entailed in a \"discussion\" and what is entailed in the term \"safe space\".  To me, a discussion must have, among other things, diversity of thought or position.  This implies that there will be dissent.  In the usage of the term \"safe space\" that I've experienced, dissent was not allowed, in fact it was in some cases violently rejected.  If there is no room for dissent, then what exists within is not a discussion, it's a group affirmation.  You do not walk away from a group affirmation having learned anything, although it might make you feel better about yourself.  A discussion provides the possibility of learning something, gaining awareness of other viewpoints, understanding of someone who is different than you, and perhaps the possibility of convincing someone else to change their viewpoint to share yours.On a university campus in a shared space, I'd very much hope that any discussion that occurs about any topic, but especially topics of politics and social mores has room for dissent.  For instance, I'd hope that my dissenting opinion regarding the existence or establishment of \"safe spaces\" would be welcome, if not applauded in a discussion about identity politics on a university campus.  At the same time, if I were on said campus and I heard someone expressing a grossly bigoted opinion, such as something which is blatantly racist or sexist, I would confront them and provide them my dissenting viewpoint to their bigotry and hope that it were welcomed, if not embraced by the person who I was having the disagreement with.  University life is supposed to be about having your viewpoints that you grew up with challenged, meeting new people who are different than you, finding out about the vast diversity of opinions and thought that exists in the world, and opening your mind to the possibilities that life holds.  When we use social means to censure people and demand the cessation of dissent in the name of not causing offense, we trade away the possibility of teaching students about the vast possibilities of the world in favor of not rocking the boat.",

No matter what you have done, God will forgive you. No matter what you have done, God loves you.2.

One student who was struggling with the revelation of her childhood abuse told GRACE she was placed on disciplinary counseling after she was caught smoking cigarettes, and Chancellor Bob Jones III attempted to impose an even harsher sentence of restricting her to campus for a semester.>Particularly harrowing was the experience of a student who alleged that her pastor had been raping her since she was 15, and who came to BJU officials when she became pregnant as a result of ongoing coercive sex with the pastor. But because she had lied about going off campus to meet him, BJU kicked her out of school.>BJU officials defended its comingling of counseling and discipline as something that made sense within the school\u2019s enduring adherence to the practice of in loco parentis\u2014 the quasi-parental role that most colleges abandoned fifty years ago\u2014but students described its effect as both chilling and retaliatory.",

Or that they enjoy square dancing?The harm that fundie universities like OKWU have done to students who disagree ever so slightly with their idiotic version of religion is demonstrable and significant. Your argument that students somehow \"should have known better\" is, IMO, fundamentally misinformed.> And this is evidence of what, exactly?That OKWU is a safe space and that safe spaces have always existed, but they usually function to shelter people who are aligned with popular opinion / cultural norms. You know, like social norms (e.g., not employing publicly out gay people, looking the other way when transvestites are assaulted, etc.) protecting homophobes from having to knowingly interact with the icky gay people.OKWU is a safe space for people who don't want to have to interact with anyone who does not subscribe to their particular brand of nutty American puritan christianity.   It's a place where people can be openly homophobic and openly judge other people's sexual morality without being socially ostracized like they would be in the real world.Just in case my opinion isn't clear by now: Everett Piper is a massive hypocrite who runs a religious commune with strict codes of conduct while also appealing to liberal values. He doesn't actually give a shit about free speech or dissenting opinions. It's impossible to take someone seriously when they claim universities aren't safe spaces while also expelling people for disagreeing with a very particular and very whacky form of christianity.",

OKWU could not be more clear on this point.In contrast, Yale and many other universities claim to embrace free expression.

His reputation extended far and wide throughout the land and many students gathered to study under him.One day an infamous young warrior arrived at the village. He was determined to be the first man to defeat the great master. Along with his strength, he had an uncanny ability to spot and exploit any weakness in an opponent. He would wait for his opponent to make the first move, thus revealing a weakness, and then would strike with merciless force and lightning speed. No one had ever lasted with him in a match beyond the first move.Much against the advice of his concerned students, the old master gladly accepted the young warrior\u2019s challenge. As the two squared off for battle, the young warrior began to hurl insults at the old master. He threw dirt and spit in his face. For hours he verbally assaulted him with every curse and insult known to mankind. But the old warrior merely stood there motionless and calm. Finally, the young warrior exhausted himself. Knowing he was defeated, he left feeling shamed.Somewhat disappointed that he did not fight the insolent youth, the students gathered around the old master and questioned him. \u201cHow could you endure such an indignity? How did you drive him away?\u201d\u201cIf someone comes to give you a gift and you do not receive it,\u201d the master replied, \u201cto whom does the gift belong?\u201d",

I'll bet that you'll notice that it is swarming with state officials - typically students who work part time for the state in a \"Student Activities\" office.Maybe you'll see one of their managers, a \"Director of Student Union Services\" or something similar.  Ask how many people worked in that office 10 years ago vs. today, and I'll bet that, more often than not, you'll find that the size of these offices have increased by 50% or more during that time.The consequence is that student governments, who traditionally ran all the operations of Student Unions and did a great job of it, are now pushed out of this function, in favor of state officials and state directives running them instead.And these state directives almost always include infantifacation of events and decor in the Student Union.I have observed this phenomenon at SUNY New Paltz, Binghamton University, the University of Connecticut, UMD College Park (although the food co-cop there is amazing and serves as a partial counter-example) and half a dozen other campuses.Every time I ask about it, I'm told that it's part of a nationwide trend.It's bullshit.

    "text": "I wonder how \"real\" is this \"safe space\" trend that the US is talking about lately. Is it an actual thing or a passing trend which will be forgotten till summer?In any case its one of the weirdest things ever, older generations accusing the younger of not being radical enough. Perhaps the youths are right though, some freedoms are just too much, we don't need to exert them, the same way we don't need privacy anymore. There is value in safety, familiarity, coziness, instead of being out in the open wind. It's perhaps some kind of alienation towards multiculturalism/multiethnicism, and the constant bickering that comes with democracy.Safe spaces come at a cost though, as they inevitably turn to a form of terrorism, radical religious extremist groups for example begin with the formation of safe walled gardens in their communities.",

Take the case of Fullerton's Math department earlier this year.Another thing that bothers me is that the story could be anecdotal -- the lack of detail makes me suspicious as to whether it's true, or just propaganda that the author is using to enforce that students should accept what they are taught without question.",

Students expect to receive a useful education, and instructors expect to have their research and publication subsidized, and the university expects to receive payment from the former and quality of service from the latter.Anything that disrupts that transaction - such as university presidents getting huffy that \"kids these days are too sensitive\" - tends to cause a failure of the end result of all three components: education itself.I wish more tertiary-institution administrators realized that they're operating a business, not some kind of wisdom dispensary that students should feel grateful for being allowed to attend.",

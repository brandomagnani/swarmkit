A/B testing is usually done to determine which choice is the best, how will they know if they don't test?  Also who decides what is best?  Does best mean that it's incredibly easy to use for 90% of tasks but terribly hard for the other 10% for some reason, or that it's moderately easy to use for 100% of tasks?> I think experiments should be done in controlled conditions with mock data and informed participants.The problem with this is that the mock data won't get you applicable results in a lot of cases.  Along with that, an informed participant affects the selection further reducing how well the results reflect the real population of users.

Are people saying that they're perfectly fine for their Windows/Mac/Linux distribution to track everything they do? The apps they use? The sites they visit? Because that's basically what ChromeOS does. It even tracks the documents you print to your desktop printer (routed through Google's cloud print service).You aren't even anonymous when you use ChromeOS - you must be signed into your Google account. Just as a reminder, your Google account = your name, your date of birth, your location and optional phone number. In other words, some of your most personal and private information all tied to the activity you conduct on ChromeOS.Google states that it does not read the content of your emails in GMail (emails are scanned by computer), but you could argue that your browsing habits are just as private and personal. No such assurances on how they handle this data. Does Google disassociate the identity of the user from their activity? If not, then who sees this data at Google? How long is this data kept for? These are important questions, but you won't find answers in Google's privacy policy. (And you're unlikely to find many in the tech community asking Google about them either.)I would never recommend an OS that tracked the activity of students so relentlessly, especially when many students are too young to understand the horrendous privacy implications of using ChromeOS. Other companies like Microsoft are rightfully criticised for their tracking in Windows 10, yet Google gets a completely free ride. It's just baffling.",

For now here's an observation.Situations which produces large amounts of \"externalities\" seem to produce this strange scenario where we fight against potential nightmare scenarios. Externalities being defined as something that occurs as a result of the new process outside the expected system. Global warming from burning fossil fuels or secondhand smoke are prime examples although easier to think about because the outcomes are tangible.This brings up the question, \"How do we handle this thing that effects people on a large scale?\" It's useful to ask, \"What's the worst outcome of this we can imagine\" which might be along the lines of 1984. Terrifying because the government is normally the vehicle that is used to regulate large amounts of externalities and data collection could provide it with a large amount of power, something that the government often desires. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the government started to abuse this power very quickly and in secret; although to a lesser extent than 1984. It's limited largely by technology (which is improving at a rapid rate). How we deal with this problem now may help us avoid this dystopian situation once the technology catches up.On the other hand, we also have to look at what we get in exchange. Burning fossil fuels is so essential that maybe it's worth raising the temperature of the earth until we can develop something better. Or maybe it's just a large exercise in game theory. In the case of data collection we get a few extremely convenient services (search, automation, etc.) in exchange for lack of privacy in nearly all forms and the systems that are abstracted above us (businesses, government, economy, etc.) are shifted towards optimizing for their respective interests using the information they can glean from the collected data. These systems become arguably more efficient more powerful.These conversations effectively shape how we handle the new thing and are overall good. Privacy (and the effects of privacy) isn't really an easily quantifiable thing, but it does appear to be something that people think is worth having. The end result is most likely to be somewhere in the middle of the road; we can burn fossil fuels, but there are certain standards on the emissions to limit the externalities.So where exactly is the tradeoff \"worth it\"? It's different for everybody. For me, I think all my data that is seemingly private for me (I wouldn't let my friends read my email / texts; if it's a file in a password protected account) should be encrypted and impossible for anyone outside of that conversation to access; currently this is not the case. Facebook is a bit of a grey area because people seem to use it as if it was private and the friends feature implies that it is, but the reality is that it is not. All of this falls apart completely when everything we previously assumed was private is clearly not when it comes to organizations such as the NSA which is an organization that provides a very questionable amount of value.",

There is current evidence that it is actually a real problem as well. Fossil fuels are the revenue model for many industries, which is also the case with data collection.While it's a lesser problem, data tracking has similar qualities. We know we lose privacy, but how much and what will the effects of losing that privacy be? There is incentive to use these 'free' services. The NSA, constant data breaches by hacking groups and government trying to strong-arm companies into weakening encryption show that it's a pretty big deal. Lavabit was effectively shut down in a very shady legal manner because it didn't want to provide data on all of it's customers when just one was being targeted.If privacy really doesn't matter, give me read-only access to your emails. Then tell me when you leave the house each morning and when you arrive home. Machine learning is pretty fun, we can often learn more about you from data you think is meaningless than by reading your emails. Some portion (perhaps most) of the information on you will eventually make it's way outside of wherever it was initially stored. Oh and it's stored forever and you couldn't possibly imagine the uses or incentives on how to use that data in the future because you haven't imagined it yet.

    "text": "People seem to be conflating \"tracking user behavior\" with \"tracking user behavior without consent or transparency\". Yes, there are plenty of people opposed to the former, but that is a moot point with respect to Google.The latter, however, is symptomatic of a much bigger issue: there is a pervasive belief amongst many of the silicon elite that users simply aren't capable of making effective decisions regarding tracking, and therefore it is best if they are not allowed to make those decisions. I have heard this directly from many people, and each time it leaves me surprised.If Google were to provide real transparency into the information they track about me, that would be fantastic. I likely wouldn't even look at it, but I would know that organizations like the EFF and ACLU would serve as ombudspeople for the public. Furthermore, whichever of the big internet players does this first will likely generate a tremendous amount of brand loyalty and free marketing.I suspect current behavior won't change without legal intervention, which will potentially be adversarial, which is a shame since there are people at these companies who are much more qualified than lawmakers to anticipate and plan for the future.It's amazing that a company (and industry) that self-identifies so strongly with taking novel approaches to solving hard problems can get mired in such status quo bias.",

It doesn't matter how much information we release about this, when people are determined not to believe it.It is a frustrating experience for the people who work on them to pour time and effort into making sure a privacy policy is really precisely accurate about what is happening, and then see threads like this where people will go looking for loopholes that aren't there, and because English is fairly ambiguous they'll eventually find a way to misinterpret the words to support what they wanted to believe all along.Here's an interesting hypothetical question: if the primary effect of the conspiracy theorists is to throw bricks at the people who are trying really hard to make sure the bad things never happen, then which side are the conspiracy theorists really on?

I use as little closed-source stuff as possible now.I'm sure it is frustrating, but you'd have to thank the people in charge for that distrust. I wasn't born with it, the cloud-providers earned it. I used to think this was tin-hat territory myself.IMO, the solution is to stop storing things in the cloud, and start giving me the tools to do it myself. I have no idea how to work that out financially. If google made a \"maps app\" that was open-source and I could run on my own server, but charged for it, I would probably buy that because I like the service so much. But as it stands, I try to avoid using it as much as possible, because I simply can't trust Google.EDIT: Forgot to answer this> if the primary effect of the conspiracy theorists is to throw bricks at the people who are trying really hard to make sure the bad things never happen, then which side are the conspiracy theorists really on?At the end of the day, Google just doesn't do enough to make me think that they are \"making sure the bad things never happen\". I'm sure there are a lot of people who are trying hard to make that true, but how can I know that is true for everyone? What can you offer me other than root access to your servers? I'd honestly like a good answer to this, because I just don't have one.And the amount of data/power that Google has is just too much for me to think that they won't \"get greedy\" some day.

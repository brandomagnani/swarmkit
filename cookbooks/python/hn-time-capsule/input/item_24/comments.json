    "text": "Pivotal | ONSITE SF, NYC, Palo Alto and many, many locations worldwide | Engineers, Designers, Product Managers, Data Scientists | Visa and relocation assistanceFirst things first. We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn't matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you're smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.Pivotal's goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta really mean it. We're broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, that Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo and Sydney. We will soon be opening an office in Berlin as well, with more to come. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.-- Pivotal Labs, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.-- Cloud Foundry solves application deployment and management. We're the main contributors to CF. We're expanding what is the leading opensource PaaS and our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product ever. It's also the only PaaS I'd personally bet a company on -- except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD'd. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.-- Big Data is home to a fleet of battled-hardened products that we have been progressively open sourcing. Greenplum Database tackles some of the largest datasets in the world with the comfort and familarity of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum's distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, which we donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.-- GenerallyAt our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it's popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that's life in paradise.We provide visa and relocation assistance. In the NYC office we have about 15 people from overseas, including Australians like me.You can apply through our website: http://pivotal.io/careers.  You can also email me at jchester+hn@pivotal.io to answer any questions you might have and potentially help me score one of our generous referral bonuses.",

We've gone from dozens to thousands in a few years; turns out it's easier to scale software than hiring.Edit: speaking of asking, I asked some more about our feedback. Sometimes it's hard to give specific feedback, sometimes it's not easy to be tactful, sometimes the interviewer can't point to single concrete examples rather than a vibe arising from tiny observations and so on. On top of that there are multiple people involved in giving hire/no-hire opinions and several people coordinating different parts of the logistics.On top of that we go through a lot of interviews every week, only a few of whom we hire. The only people with a sufficiently global view of the decision are directors, and they're too swamped by all their duties to give detailed feedback to every candidate.So on the one hand, we can't always give feedback, so my original statement was wrong.

More importantly, you'll be eager to learn display advertising (banner ads, RTB) inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools. We're a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship in Santa Monica.#Position: Rails + exposure to Scala, Hbase & KafkaWe need someone to contribute to our Ruby on Rails app. It's used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It's not just boring CRUD. It provides a ton of control and insight to the team that operates our clients' campaigns; it's truly the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you'll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work. This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you'd get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of development (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms); so it's a great position if you want to develop broader technical skills while really taking advantage of your growing knowledge of our vertical.-- Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.",

The Atlas of Economic Complexity is our current online tool that lets you interactively visualize a country\u2019s trade and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide. There are also other National Atlas projects launching soon, one for Colombia and one for Mexico.Our stack:\nWe use python, django, mysql (hopefully postgres soon), elasticsearch, ansible for the back end. For the frontend, it's ember / d3 on big national projects, jquery/d3 on atlas.cid.harvard.edu/ and WebGL with Three.js on some 3d projects that we\u2019ve launched such as globe.cid.harvard.edu/ Everything we do is open source: https://github.com/cid-harvardDemo of the current atlas:\nAn example of how the atlas is useful take this story here: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/21/world/europe/h...Last year the EU placed sanctions on sales of oil equipment, but not on oil imports. Why could this be? Almost 70% of russia's exports are petrol products: http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/all...And Russia exports the overwhelming majority of its petroleum products to Europe:\nhttp://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/sho...The big blue chunk is europe, meaning a sanction would really hurt Russia. However, when you look at who else the EU could buy from, the situation is grim: http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/net_export/sho...There\u2019s practically no one who\u2019s a real political ally that Europe could depend on, save for Norway. It\u2019s interesting how it\u2019s practically impossible to buy oil from a country that\u2019s relatively stable and doing well on the HDI front.\nIt\u2019s worse if you consider the cost of transporting it, and how close Russia is:\nhttp://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/map/net_export/show/all...Which probably explains why EU hasn't placed sanctions on oil imports from Russia.\nGet in touch:Send us some work you're proud of to greg_shapiro at hks dot harvard dot edu.",

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We\u2019re self funded and doubling yearly. As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we\u2019re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We're currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We\u2019re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).We looking for four main strengths in you:\u25e6 skill: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.\u25e6 desire to learn: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.\u25e6 understanding: our product team is great but not infallible. You\u2019ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users\u2019 best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You\u2019ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.\u25e6 clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s planned, you\u2019ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what\u2019s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again. Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we\u2019re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you\u2019ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, building API integrations, and databases (particularly SQL Server).We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight. So, if you\u2019ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

We enable scientists to run experiments on our automated work cells via our web application from anywhere in the world. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges for our web devs range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, React, and CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.Our bioengineers apply math to hard biological problems, ranging from liquid handling optimization to reasoning about how \"identical\" reagents diverge over time to interfere with reproducibility.

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after three years, we\u2019re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 48,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.We\u2019re a team of 85 (37 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers and engineering managers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.Check us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs, or check out our recent press here:\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-thir...",

We have an amazing team of developers, designers and sales folks that are on a mission to simplify and automate all the annoying admin work small businesses have to put up with (and make the workplace way more fun for those companies' employees along the way).We've recently raised $1.8M and we need your help!About the position:\nAs a PM at GoCo, you'll be a mini-CEO. You'll need to help us figure out what we should build and how we should build it. And you'll probably make mistakes along the way. But that's OK. We're all about learning quick.\nThe ideal GoCo PM would demonstrate these 4 main traits: \n- Excellent communicator: You'll need to be a great listener so you can understand users' problems. And once you understand those problems, you'll need to convey your proposed solutions via email, PowerPoint decks, whiteboarding or just sitting down and talking with devs, design, and execs.\n- Half analytical, half creative: You'll quantify and prioritize what's going to deliver the most bang for the buck. Sometimes, those features won't be very creative. What's worked before can work now. But sometimes, you'll really have to really think out of the box.\n- Design: You don't need to be a designer. You don't need to know how to make things beautiful. But you do need to know how to distill complicated flows into something that's intuitive and simple. \n- Bias for action: You need to get stuff done!\nAs a PM, you'll report directly to the seasoned Chief Product Officer and have massive opportunities for personal growth, leadership, and career advancement in a rapidly growing company.You don't need any direct PM experience (though that's awesome). You just need to demonstrate the traits outlined above. Any experience with HR or insurance is a big plus.Struck your fancy?  Email me, Michael Gugel (the co-founder and CPO) at gugel@goco.io.",

In business since 1997 and based out of Rochester, NY, Whole Latte Love sells high end coffee beans and equipment to thousands of people around the world. At Whole Latte Love we are about everything coffee and we put passion behind everything we do. We're looking for a couple of developers to help scale out an in-house development team and expand a successful US-based business overseas. This is going to mean a lot of development to grow from our current monorail storefronts to a more service-based platform.Right now, we are built on Rails with a heavily customized Spree back end. We deploy to AWS via Ansible, and are backed by MySQL and Redis. Our front-ends are primarily Deface/ERB - this is a traditional multi-page app for the time being. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and are always open to evaluating new technologies and platforms. We're not looking specifically for front-end, back-end or devops specialists, although we have pain points that would be served by any of these. Rather, our ideal candidate will build a role around themselves, and be able to find multiple ways they can contribute across our systems, without getting distracted or going too deep down the rabbit hole. We aren't tied to any specific amount of experience, but we expect that you'll be able to take a feature or issue to production without too much hand holding (what might be called a mid-level or senior developer).It's a low-key work environment, and we have a lot of management buy-in to build as effective a development team as possible. Development is primarily remote, so proactive communication, responsibility and accountability are at least as important as technical ability. There will need to be regular overlap with core hours (8:30-5:00 EST) but we can work out the specifics of what that overlap entails depending on where you live.Please write to coffeejobs@wholelattelove.com with an introduction and resume. An online code repository is helpful and even encouraged, but absolutely not required. Thanks!",
